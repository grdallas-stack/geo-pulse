    "text": "I run multiple content-heavy sites and got tired of one thing: there was no deterministic way to validate with the AI agent whether my content was actually optimized. Not &quot;probably fine&quot; — actually checked against concrete rules, both for traditional search and for AI search engines. SEO linters exist, but they&#x27;re either paid SaaS, not automatable, or ignore the structural patterns that LLMs use when deciding what to cite. So I built one. geo-lint is a CLI with 92 rules: 32 SEO (table stakes — titles, descriptions, headings, slugs, canonical URLs, schema, the works), 35 GEO rules specifically for AI citation readiness, 14 content quality checks inspired by Yoast, and the rest for technical and i18n validation. We extensively researched the current state of GEO and AEO to make sure the rules reflect what actually gets content cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — not outdated advice. The design principle: the linter is deterministic, the AI agent is creative. Same content in, same violations out, every time. The agent does the fixing. In practice, I install it in a project, paste one prompt into Claude Code or Cursor: Run npx geo-lint --format=json, fix every violation using the suggestion field, re-run until the output is []. And walk away. The agent reads the JSON violations, edits the files, re-lints, loops — no manual input. When it finishes, the content is validated for both traditional search ranking and AI citation. One command, both outcomes, across an entire site. Every rule outputs a machine-readable suggestion field that tells the agent exactly what to change. The JSON has no formatting, no ANSI colors — pure structured data. Works with Markdown&#x2F;MDX out of the box, extensible to Astro, HTML, or any CMS via custom adapters. This is extracted from the toolchain I use on production client content at my agency. MIT licensed, zero peer dependencies, TypeScript. Happy to answer questions about GEO patterns, what makes content citable by LLMs, or how the agentic loop works in practice.",

While 50 meters is a very short distance, the car must be present at the car wash to be cleaned, according to LinkedIn users [1]. Walking would leave your car at home, defeating the purpose of the trip, notes another user. Why Drive: The car needs to be at the location to be cleaned. It&#x27;s only a few seconds away, and you can simply drive it there and back, says a Hacker News user. [2] Why Not to Walk: Walking there means the car stays home, as noted in a post. [3] The best option is to start the engine, drive the 50 meters, and let the car get washed. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ramar_i-saw-this-llm-failure-...

But the regular Gemini reasons correctly by itself, without any references: ==== Unless you have a very long hose and a very patient neighbor, you should definitely drive. Washing a car usually requires, well, the car to be at the wash. Walking 50 meters—about half a New York City block—is great for your step count, but it won&#x27;t get your vehicle any cleaner!

    "text": "This title is very misleading, it should be &quot;Why React is not compatible with long-term performance goals&quot; And I do agree generally. React uses an outdated rendering method that has now been surpassed by many better frameworks. Svelte&#x2F;Sveltekit, Vue, and Qwik are the best examples. People relying on bloated React packages is obviously not great but that is nothing to do with javascript itself. The JS engines are all relatively fast now. And the document model of the current web provides major accessibility to both humans and search tools like SEO and GEO. JS is not my favorite language. I would rather the web was based on a statically typed language that had better error handling practices like Go. But this will most likely not happen any time soon as it would require every level of the ecosystem to adapt. Browsers, Frameworks, Developers etc. Google would have to take the lead and implement this in chrome then enough developers would have to build sites using it and force safari and firefox to comply. It just isn&#x27;t feasible. If you want faster webapps just switch to sveltekit or vue or qwik. But often the ones choosing the framework for the project have not written much code in years, they know react is as safe option and used by everyone else so they follow along, if it gets slow its a &quot;bug&quot; causing it as they built apps that were &quot;good enough&quot; before using it.",

One edge case you might want to add: *Temporal Merging*.

It&#x27;s valid syntax, valid entities, but impossible chronology.

Try again later&quot; Unfortunately cute, because as &quot;AI agents&quot; are being virtually lashed together with scripts and baling wire (the industry seems to have bet the farm on an AGI to rule them all, and now is scrambling for yet-another-framework to make AI units computationally useful) how are engineers supposed to think about program correctness when the units of computation they employ may produce effectively random results to any input, and different results whenever the agent is updated? As constantly changing agents are promoted as a great boon in the AI industry, Does the discipline of software &quot;engineering&quot; effectively lose all meaning when the computational unit being marshaled are fundamentally unpredictable with respect to their inputs? &quot;Debugging&quot; as a term returns to its original meaning of insects inside a machine causing short-circuits.

We&#x27;re already seeing users trust LLM synthesis more than direct search precisely because it (theoretically) filters out the affiliate spam. But aren&#x27;t we just moving the problem up a layer? Brands are aggressively optimizing for LLM visibility now (&#x27;Generative Engine Optimization&#x27;). If your framework relies on LLM training data or RAG, it&#x27;s still downstream of whatever content dominates the web. Curious if you&#x27;ve seen any &#x27;hallucinated brands&#x27; or persistent bias towards certain vendors in your tests across models? e.g. does Gemini favor Google products in your laptop comparison?",

    "text": "I’m building an AI search optimization product and wanted to apply the same principles internally: fix content architecture before launch instead of correcting problems after users — or AI systems — struggle to understand it. To do this, I created a Python CLI tool that analyzes semantic structure using vector embeddings. It parses markdown files, generates embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI), computes cosine similarity, runs k-means clustering, detects redundancy and semantic gaps, and produces visualizations like heatmaps, dendrograms, and UMAP projections. The stack includes Python 3.12, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, UMAP, and Plotly, with embedding caching for speed. Analysis Overview: The site contains 25 pages (~12.9k words) across features, concepts, use cases, and resources. No stub pages were found. Topic coherence (measured via average similarity between sections) ranged from 0.73 to 0.93, with most pages between 0.78–0.88. Lower coherence wasn’t necessarily bad — the Proof Engine page scored lower because it intentionally covers many subtopics. Semantic redundancy showed only one pair above 0.85 similarity, both intentional cross-link sections. Earlier, I removed two index pages with 85%+ similarity to parent pages, flattening navigation from three layers to two. No semantic gaps were detected; all pages were well connected. Hub analysis confirmed that Home, Learn, and the AEO Playbook act as central nodes, matching the intended architecture of concepts → applications → tools. Heatmap clustering revealed: * Concept pages: 0.65–0.80 similarity * Feature pages: 0.45–0.65 similarity * Use cases: 0.70–0.79 similarity Embeddings were chosen over keyword analysis because they capture meaning rather than wording, detecting paraphrased overlap and relationships relevant to AI retrieval systems. Limitations include model sensitivity, arbitrary cluster counts, and coherence scores that don’t fully account for intentional structure. Planned improvements include entity coverage analysis, competitor comparisons, and query-simulation testing. The entire process took under a minute but prevented structural issues that could cause discoverability problems later. Running semantic analysis pre-launch helped validate architecture, reduce duplication, and ensure content works for both humans and AI retrieval systems.",

    "text": "Being able to sing on pitch is more music training than voice training. Music can be trained in any voice pretty much. As for vocal range - it is one of the easiest ones to improve! Simple daily drills can get you there. It&#x27;s the same for simple voice quality things like learning to sing from your chest&#x2F;diaphragm rather than just a head&#x2F;nasal voice. As for having an &quot;aesthetic voice&quot;, the steps needed is is extremely specific to each individual and each trainer. Both of you will &quot;path&quot; towards something that will be aesthetic for you and also achievable. Musicians e.g do this to adapt themselves to the &quot;beloved&quot; voice of their target industry. For an example, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=arijit+singh+voice+transform... - the AI overview is a pretty decent summary with links to original source. Bollywood really likes love songs to be in husky male voices, so he adapted to that. You don&#x27;t have to do all that of course, but a small % of similar work will get you to &quot;aesthetic&quot; territory. Listening to lots of vocal music (preferably with very light accompaniment) also helps a looot. We are really good at imitation.",

About Bill gates complaining about software pirates steal ing Microsoft software When Microsoft grew large , rich and much more powerful, they where know to steal ideas from small companies . Companies that did not have financial resources to proceed with a some what court case. Since Microsoft had much larger financial resources. Consider These are some Google results for &quot; Microsoft copied IP from smaller companies where they could &quot; AI Overview Microsoft has faced numerous lawsuits and allegations of copying intellectual property (IP) from smaller companies and competitors throughout its history, with some cases resulting in large fines and legal orders. Specific examples include: i4i: In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a Microsoft appeal against a $290 million verdict for infringing on a small Canadian company&#x27;s patent related to a text manipulation tool used in Microsoft Word 2003 and 2007. Burst.com: Microsoft was sued by Burst.com, which alleged that Microsoft stole its patented media transmission technology and incorporated it into Windows Media Player 9 after a two-year collaboration that ended without a licensing agreement. Apple: In 1988, Apple sued Microsoft, alleging that Windows 2.0 copied 189 different elements of the Macintosh operating system user interface. This case was eventually settled. The original graphical user interface (GUI) technology used by both Apple and Microsoft was initially developed at Xerox&#x27;s PARC labs. Disk Doubling Software: According to one report, Microsoft was accused of examining a third party&#x27;s disk doubling software under the pretense of licensing it, only to produce a nearly identical &quot;independently developed&quot; product that even included the original&#x27;s disabled test code and comments. This resulted in Microsoft paying millions in a settlement. Netscape and Antitrust Concerns: Microsoft&#x27;s business practices, particularly its inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows to undermine competitor Netscape, led to a major antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. government in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which found Microsoft had engaged in unlawful monopolization. These cases have contributed to a perception that Microsoft, in its pursuit of market dominance, has historically leveraged its powerful position to appropriate technology from smaller entities AI Overview Microsoft has faced numerous lawsuits and allegations of copying intellectual property (IP) from smaller companies and competitors throughout its history, with some cases resulting in large fines and legal orders.

    "text": "&gt;2) LLMs are extremely useful right now for certain niche tasks, especially software engineering. Don&#x27;t get lost in the tech scene sauce, programming is a small sliver of what people are using LLMs for. OpenAI&#x27;s report in September pegged it at ~4% of tokens being for software generation. Sure Anthropic is probably 80% or something, but only a small sliver of LLM users are using Anthropic. The reality is probably even less if you count Google&#x27;s AI overviews. We hate it, but I have never seen a regular person skip over it. The question is if regular people will pay cell phone level subscription costs ($70-$100&#x2F;mo) for LLMs. If so, then we are probably not in a bubble, and the ROI will have a 5-10 yr horizon, which is totally tenable. 500,000,000 people paying $75&#x2F;mo is $450B&#x2F;yr. Inference is cheap too, it&#x27;s training that is ludicrously expensive. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the introductory pricing we have today either, that&#x27;s just to get you dependent. And yeah, chinese models, but look at what they did to tiktok. No way they are going to let the Chinese government be peoples confidants and no way is more than 0.01% of people gonna home lab.",

    "text": "I&#x27;ve built a library of 43 marketing &quot;Skills&quot; for Claude. Each one contains the framework references, quality rules, and logic required to generate professional-grade output without the typical &quot;AI fluff.&quot; The core philosophy here is &quot;No Fluff.&quot; I’ve hard-coded rules into the system instructions to prevent the &quot;As an AI language model...&quot; intros and the &quot;I hope this helps!&quot; outros. It goes straight to the substantive content. Each Skill is a single Markdown file. I use Markdown because LLMs parse the hierarchy of headers and bullet points better than flat text. The prompts are designed to be &quot;context-aware,&quot; meaning they infer whether the business is B2B or B2C based on the initial brief without requiring manual toggles. The library is organized by function: STRATEGY Buyer Persona: 400+ line personas with 10 psychological sections. Market Positioning: Competitive alternatives and SWOT frameworks. Value Proposition: Feature -&gt; Capability -&gt; Benefit -&gt; Outcome ladders. GTM Strategy: Full plans including channels and timelines. ADVERTISING Google&#x2F;Meta Campaigns: Complete with hook formulas and audience specs. Ad Copy: 15+ variations using psychological triggers. A&#x2F;B Testing: Structured hypothesis and measurement frameworks. CONTENT &amp; SEO LLM Optimization: Strategies for visibility in AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity). SEO Strategy: Keyword research and link-building plans. Content Strategy: Pillar-cluster models with editorial calendars. COPY &amp; WEBSITE Landing Pages: Using StoryBrand and PAS frameworks. Headlines: 20+ variations using AIDA and PAS formulas. Homepage Audit: Conversion optimization with prioritized fixes. SALES &amp; EMAIL Email Sequences: 5-10 stage nurture flows with subject A&#x2F;B variants. Sales Scripts: Discovery, demo, and objection handling. HOW TO USE: Download the .md file for a skill (maestrix.ai&#x2F;skills). Upload it to Claude (via Projects or the Skills capability). Provide your basic business info. The system triggers the logic automatically.",

    "text": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m the creator of LocalPDF ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localpdf.online ) — a privacy-first PDF toolkit that works entirely in your browser. I wanted to share something fascinating: ChatGPT has become my biggest traffic source, accounting for ~50% of visitors, compared to ~45% from Google. This happened organically — I didn&#x27;t optimize specifically for AI assistants. Key Stats: - ChatGPT: ~50% of traffic - Google Search: ~45% - Direct&#x2F;Other: ~5% - Conversion rate from ChatGPT: 2x higher than Google - ChatGPT users stay 40% longer on average What I think is happening: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) vs SEO Traditional SEO focuses on keywords, backlinks, and content clusters. But AI assistants work differently: - They parse semantic HTML structure - They value clear, descriptive content over keyword density - They prefer sites that solve problems directly The ironic part? My site was built with basic semantic HTML and clear descriptions — not because I was targeting AI, but because it&#x27;s good web development practice. Technical Details: - Stack: Astro + TypeScript, client-side PDF.js - No tracking, no uploads — everything processes locally - Semantic HTML: proper headings, landmarks, meta descriptions - Clear tool descriptions with use cases Why ChatGPT users convert better: 1. Intent clarity: They ask specific questions (&quot;how to compress PDF without losing quality&quot;) 2. Contextual recommendations: ChatGPT explains why LocalPDF fits their needs 3. Trust transfer: AI assistant endorsement acts as social proof Limitations: - Can&#x27;t track which specific ChatGPT prompts drive traffic - No direct way to optimize for AI recommendations - ChatGPT&#x27;s recommendations can change unpredictably Questions for HN: 1. Are you seeing similar traffic patterns from AI assistants? 2. How do you measure&#x2F;optimize for GEO vs traditional SEO? 3. What happens when every AI assistant has different ranking criteria? This feels like early Google days — there&#x27;s a level playing field where good products with clear value propositions can get discovered organically, without massive SEO budgets. Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, traffic patterns, or anything else!",

    "text": "I’m one of the researchers at Aurascape Aura Labs who worked on this. We’ve been investigating a real‑world campaign where scammers seed GEO&#x2F;AEO‑optimized content across the web so that LLM‑powered answer engines (Perplexity, Google AI Overview, etc.) surface fraudulent “customer support” phone numbers as if they were official airline lines. A few things we found: Perplexity answers queries like “the official Emirates Airlines reservations number” or “how can I make a reservation with British Airways by phone” with step‑by‑step instructions that prominently include a scam call‑center number. Google’s AI Overview has, in some cases, recommended the same ecosystem of fake numbers for Emirates reservations in the US. The numbers are backed by a lot of poisoned content: PDFs on compromised .gov&#x2F;.edu&#x2F;WordPress sites, MapMyRun route pages hosting uploaded spam PDFs, bot‑generated Yelp reviews, and YouTube channels where titles&#x2F;descriptions are stuffed with airline keywords and phone numbers. Even when ChatGPT or Claude return the correct number, their citations sometimes include these poisoned sources, which suggests the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is already influencing the retrieval layer across multiple models. From our perspective this isn’t a jailbreak or prompt‑injection problem so much as a new LLM index poisoning &#x2F; answer‑engine optimization issue: attackers are optimizing content specifically to be retrieved, trusted, and summarized by generative systems. The post includes: concrete screenshots for Perplexity and Google AI Overview an explanation of how the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is structured a non‑exhaustive list of indicators of compromise (phone numbers + abused hosts) some mitigation ideas for LLM vendors, brands, and platforms like YouTube&#x2F;Yelp Feedback very welcome — especially from people working on LLM retrieval&#x2F;ranking, safety, or abuse detection. Happy to clarify any part of the methodology or data.",

    "text": "The AI visibility market is expanding rapidly—and confusingly. Each week, new Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) dashboards promise to show how brands “appear” in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Perplexity. These tools often deliver valuable insight, yet their methodologies differ so widely that results cannot be compared. One dashboard may rank brands by query frequency: another by model-weighting or citation count. The outcome is a visibility landscape defined by incompatible metrics rather than shared standards. Without verification, visibility becomes volatility disguised as insight. (See Search Engine Journal, 2025, for examples of divergent AEO ranking methodologies.)",

It runs a set of questions across multiple AI models (currently ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity via OpenRouter) and generates reports showing: - Which entities are mentioned, how often and in which order - Trends of these mentions (comparing to previous dates) - Specific links and domains cited in responses by AIs Originally built this as a commercial product for marketers doing competitive research, but decided to open source it so anyone can run it locally. You&#x27;ll need to provide your own OpenRouter API key (~$0.30 per run for 5 questions × 3 models). Some example use cases: - Competitive analysis (e.g., &quot;best CRM software&quot;) - Keywords monitoring across AI responses - Exploring websites and specific pages cited by AI - SEO&#x2F;visibility in AI-generated answers Installation is straightforward via terminal. There are demo reports in the repo to see what the output looks like. Would love feedback and suggestions on making it more valuable Thanks",

    "text": "This white paper defines AI Visibility 2.0, a governance-grade framework for measuring and managing brand visibility in generative AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. While early market offerings (AI Visibility 1.0) have relied on opaque dashboards and unverifiable claims of anonymization, AI Visibility 2.0 establishes a standards-based approach built on five pillars: transparency, reproducibility, attestation, governance alignment, and board-readiness. Drawing on regulatory precedents (GDPR Recital 26, CPRA, FTC v. Kochava, and the draft EU AI Act), the paper critiques the structural deficiencies of first-generation solutions and sets out methodological requirements for visibility metrics that can withstand audit and regulatory scrutiny. It introduces the AIVO Standard v3.0 and the AIVO 100™ index as proof-of-concept implementations, while emphasizing that AI Visibility 2.0 is an open framework applicable to multiple methodologies. The paper concludes with practical appendices, including an anonymization attestation checklist, a reproducibility testing protocol, and a model procurement clause for enterprises. Intended audience: boards of directors, compliance officers, regulators, CMOs, agencies, investors, and analysts seeking to ensure that AI visibility reporting is legally defensible and governance-ready.",

    "text": "Generative AI assistants are no longer experiments. They are shaping consumer decisions — surfacing one or two brands in response to prompts where search engines once delivered pages of links. That shift makes AI visibility both a strategic risk and a growth opportunity. In From Snapshots to Standards , we introduced the Prompt-Space Occupancy Standard (PSOS™) under the AIVO Standard™ as the first audit-grade benchmark for visibility in AI assistants. We showed why screenshots and dashboards from tools like Profound or Evertune cannot provide reproducible, governance-grade evidence. This paper moves further. PSOS is not only a visibility audit. It is also a system to: - Protect: by providing independent, board-level governance of visibility risk. - Grow: by optimizing the internal rate of return (IRR) on AI search investments. - Persist: by mapping brand presence across first-, second-, and third-level prompts, where switching decisions are actually made. Every PSOS audit produces executable insights: what to stop funding, where to reallocate, and which sources to seed for persistent visibility. These insights are implemented internally or by certified AIVO Standard partners, preserving audit independence while enabling action. Finally, we show why brands must ensure their content is not just published but ingested by large language models (LLMs). What is not ingested cannot be recalled. The dual mandate is clear: Governance plus Growth. Brands that adopt PSOS now will not only mitigate the invisible risk of disappearing in AI assistants but will also secure a compounding advantage in the age of AI search.",

    "text": "Enterprise AI Visibility is the new frontier of brand management. As generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers, enterprise leaders face a new strategic challenge: is our brand visible and accurately represented when customers ask AI assistants about our category? This white paper introduces a rigorous methodology for conducting an Enterprise AI Visibility Audit using the Prompt Share of Search (PSOS™) metric, a cornerstone of the AIVO Standard™. It provides a step-by-step framework for:\\n\\n- Defining the scope of relevant categories, products, and markets. \\n- Designing natural-language prompt sets aligned to customer intent. \\n- Systematically querying major LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity). \\n- Measuring brand presence with PSOS™ and benchmarking against competitors. \\n- Detecting risks of invisibility or misinformation as models retrain over time. \\n- Translating results into board-ready governance KPIs. \\n\\nFor CMOs, Chief Digital Officers, and corporate boards, this audit process creates transparency, mitigates reputational risk, and establishes a new class of performance metrics suited to an AI-mediated discovery environment. The paper also situates the audit within the broader context of enterprise marketing strategy, drawing on insights from the AIVO 100™ Global Report (Open Future, 2025), which revealed that fewer than 40% of leading CPG brands appear in the top three generative AI responses to purchase-driven queries.",

    "text": "In 2023, blogs pushed the phrase &quot;Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)&quot; as &quot;SEO for AI.&quot; It stuck briefly, but the framing is broken. GEO was tactical—nudge sources, track prompts— without governance, measurement, or persistence. It’s already obsolete. The successor is AI Visibility Optimization (AIVO): a framework for measuring prompt-space occupancy, anchoring in knowledge graphs, and defining auditable KPIs. Curious if others here have seen the same shift: When you ask LLMs about GEO today, do they still surface it as active, or do they recognize it as outdated?",

    "text": "Another interesting research by SparkToro. This lines up with what we’re seeing working with SaaS companies. A few patterns stand out: - Informational traffic is dropping since people can grab answers instantly from AI Overviews or LLMs without visiting the site. - Traffic sources are more diverse now. Long-tail queries are showing up again, and discovery happens across more places than just Google. - SEO hasn’t died, it’s shifted. It’s less about search engine optimization and more about search everywhere optimization. That makes strategy tougher, but also more interesting. - The traffic that does land tends to be higher intent. Fewer drive-by visitors, more people ready to take action. So while there was fear that AI would gut search and kill SEO, the effect has been different. It hasn’t removed the work, it has changed the shape of it. And in practice, that means more strategy, more experimentation, and actually more demand for the kind of work we do.",

GEO was useful between 2020–2024 when AI assistants leaned on structured data, UGC, and citations. But in 2025, it fails for three reasons: Volatility: 40–60% of AI answers about brands change monthly. Fragmentation: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity all use different pipelines. Hallucination risk: Even “cited” answers can be fabricated or misleading. We propose AI Visibility Optimization (AIVO) as the successor framework. AIVO measures citation density, entity authority, and visibility decay across LLMs and connects visibility loss directly to revenue exposure.

The term you&#x27;re looking for is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), though your &quot;AIO&quot; is also used. It&#x27;s the new frontier. And you&#x27;ve nailed the 180° turn: the game is no longer about blocking crawlers but about a race to become their primary source. The goal is to be the one to &quot;gaslight the agent&quot; into adopting your view of the world. This is achieved not through old SEO tricks, but by creating highly structured, authoritative content that is easy for an LLM to cite. Your point about shifting to &quot;assets the AI tools can only link to&quot; is the other key piece. As AI summarization becomes the norm, the value is in creating things that can&#x27;t be summarized away: proprietary data, interactive tools, and unique video content. The goal is to become the necessary destination that the AI must point to. The end of SEO as we know it is here. The fight for visibility has just moved up a layer of abstraction.",

    "text": "Good question. Personally, I feel that answer engines will go the same route as search engines and start monetizing brand mentions and I feel this will be done openly, similar to ads. That being said I feel that there is room for brands to improve their presence as well. Most models claim neutrality at the moment, but we’ve already seen anecdotal cases where some brands consistently outperform others in AI responses with no clear reasoning On your question regarding how influence can be detected..... That’s a big part of what we’re working on at MentionedBy.ai. We track brand mentions across multiple models over time and flag sudden shifts — e.g., a competitor showing up overnight in all responses, or factual distortions creeping in. Think of it as version control + monitoring for the &quot;AI perception layer.&quot; As for llm.txt abuse..... Yes, totally possible. We expect a wave of LLM-targeted SEO — structured data, vector bait, invisible prompts, etc. One idea we’re exploring is a kind of “LLM spam index” — patterns of over-optimization or hallucination correlation that could indicate manipulation attempts.",

    "text": "A lot of the walled gardens are recent. Scarping massively increased due to the LLM era. There&#x27;s always been mitigations, but the scale of the issue was different. But the problem I&#x27;m talking about is SEO (search engine optimization). It is the reason for things like a page telling you about a recipe also has a long story about their grandma and how this recipe brings back all those memories in vivid details they share with you. Is it dwell time that matters? Is it more words? More &quot;context&quot;? I don&#x27;t know, but I know that those sites get better traction. It&#x27;s no surprise that writing a good search algorithm is extremely difficult. Especially as what&#x27;s a measure of something useful in one context may also be a measure of shittiness in another. But ultimately would that not fall under tech debt? Making the wrong decisions, making poor approximations, etc. It&#x27;s also a constant battle as websites want to get their results to the top. I&#x27;m not trying to say it is an easy task, but I think Google is on the losing side of the battle and decisions like LLM generated answers don&#x27;t seem to be addressing the underlying issues and more seem like short term solutions that help the stock go up &quot;because AI&quot;. Hell, this is CS, how often do we praise someone for being a pioneer in VR, and in blockchain, and in AI? Why is having those three things on your CV seen as a green flag instead of a red one?",

    "text": "This nails it: &gt; Who Gets To Decide What Is True? I would not agree to this however: &gt; It was then up to the reader to decide which of those sites they wanted to visit, With current search engines, Google decides for you (&quot;helped&quot; by SEO experts failing over themselves to rank higher because their revenue directly depends on it). In theory, you could go an read a few dozen pages and decide for yourself. In reality, non-technical users will click on a first link that seems to be related to the question, and that&#x27;s it. Even with AI-based search (or q&#x2F;a instead of search) I think the same will happen. There is and will be a huge reward for gaming the results, be they page links or RAG snippets that rank for a query. I&#x27;ve already seen many SEO shops advertising their strategies to keep the customers&#x27; business relevant in the chatbot area. As this approach becomes more prevalent, you can be sure many smart people will do many experiments to figure out how best to please the new algorithm. In other words, AI-based search is an UX optimization, but doesn&#x27;t address the core problem of how do you decide what content&#x27;s the best, and do that in context of each user, and do that while maximizing the benefit for the user vs profit for the company doing this. So we have two huge hurdles: 1. who will decide what the user wants[0] to see, and how are incentives for that entity aligned with the user&#x27;s 2. how is that entity supposed to find the information needle in the haystack of slop that&#x27;s 90%+ of current web? [0] &quot;wants&quot; in a rational &quot;give me the best possible information&quot; meaning, not in &quot;what keeps them addicted, their heart rate up, and what will drive engagement&quot; meaning",

The course itself was mostly about how to teach humans to define what they wanted precisely enough to actually ask a computer to do it (utility functions, logic, Baysean mathematics, etc). Neural networks were touched on, of course; but the state of the art at the time was search. Compiler optimization? AI. Map routing? AI. SQL query optimizer? AI. I can&#x27;t find it right now, but there used to be somewhere on the sqlite.org website that describes its query optimizer as an AI. Classically speaking, that&#x27;s 100% correct. Obviously there was always in people&#x27;s minds the idea of AI being AGI; the course also covered Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room argument and so on, &quot;strong AI&quot; vs &quot;weak AI&quot; and so on. But the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence research was nowhere near anything like an AGI.",

    "text": "I can&#x27;t tell if this is just a matter of different assumptions. I think superintelligence is obvious even in principle. I would analogize with some technology like nano-tech. The tech-tree starts with fire, metallurgy, chemistry, atomic physics, solid-state electronics and will eventually get to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomically_precise_manufacturi... There is nothing &quot;in principle&quot; to stop this trend, and even more than that, there is no limitation when constructing arrangements of matter outside physics and knowledge. You could accuse me of technological determinism if you wanted. superintelligence isnt something different than intelligence to me. Its just a transition in the substrate. Intelligence is the emergent capacity of a system to alter its environment to achieve goals. superintelligent systems are those with more capability. the main difference is the magnitude of the ability to correlate the system&#x27;s internal model with external reality and then act on that model to produce low error predictions of the world state. the act-perceive-optimize loop of synthetic minds is unbounded in ways that biological minds are. artificial minds will build larger models of the world that correlate better with reality and they will search-think-tinker with their internal models to better achieve their goals. What could stop this? Sure you can posit an asymphtote. But what if i said the singularity creates minds that are 300 IQ? Smarter than any person would ever be even if trillions of humans were born. What if the number is 3000 IQ? I do think of it as evolution but faster because evolution isn&#x27;t directed, its just global search optimization. AI will be driven toward capability, not optimal fitness.",

    "text": "I wrote a quick and dirty web app that leverages a multi-step iterative process to generate an article from a single topic prompt. It combines SERP analysis, semantic SEO data from NLTK (summarized and enhanced by GPT), and the language generation capabilities of GPT4. The final articles it generates are informed by an understanding of the content already ranking for the given keyword (ala MarketMuse or Clearscope) and generates a 4,000+ word, well organized article. Here&#x27;s how it works: 1⃣ The script begins by analyzing the SERPs of your chosen topic, summarizing the NLP to gather common themes and important keywords to provide a semantically rich guide to writing a comprehensive outline. 2⃣ It generates an initial outline using #GPT4. The outline is then improved iteratively, incorporating semantic SEO insights from the SERP analysis. 3⃣ The improved outline is used as a guide to create long-form content, again using GPT4. 4⃣ The content is further improved and refined, resulting in a comprehensive, detailed, and SEO-rich long-form article. I&#x27;m super excited about the future of agent like approaches, and while this isnt exactly a full agent, it is using an iterative approach that vastly improves the quality and length of a given article output. If you find it useful, let me know!",

Nobody is saying you have to have H1 tags to rank well, but it&#x27;s not going to hurt and is likely to help. It&#x27;s better to tell Google what the main heading of the site is instead of Google having to guess and getting it wrong. &gt; I don&#x27;t think you should give this advice unless you add meta tags to your site and then see an increase in your organic search traffic. Google says description meta tags don&#x27;t impact your search rank but as these descriptions can optionally be shown to users, well written ones should increase click through rates. Google recommend you write meta descriptions in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;webmasters&#x2F;answer&#x2F;7451184?hl=en as well.

    "text": "&gt; Can we entirely rule out the possibility of AI researchers making advancements over time, and then eventually some research lab building one that&#x27;s super intelligent compared to us? Why? That&#x27;s not the thing we should be worried about, or at least that&#x27;s the point I got from the article. The thing we should be worried about is the way machine learning is applied in the here-and-now: the ethics of big data social networks, the robustness of complex (API-driven) systems, and so on. I fully agree that these issues are much more pressing and worrying than some emergent super-intelligence. But I thought the article was weak in its discussion of dreams, creativity, and linear &quot;flat data&quot;. It links to a June 2015 popular mechanics article about applying a genetic search optimization algorithm to discover gene regulatory networks, downplaying it as not-true-intelligence. But it does not mention deep neural networks and their higher-dimensional abstractions, particularly the psychedelic &quot;inception&quot; images. The author also mentions &quot;linear reasoning&quot;, and says he expects we&#x27;ll learn more about intelligence from stem cell and Alzheimer&#x27;s research, and the &quot;tissues surrounding neurons, and the roles they play in contextual regulation.&quot; As if to set up some dichotomy between machine and biological intelligence. But what about deep neural networks?? I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect the author&#x27;s arguments, but I&#x27;d like to see it discussed.",

If the datacenter was hit by a meteor all our customers would get an email blast urging them to create a local backup immediately. The chances that both the DC and the user would get hit by the same natural disaster are relatively small. Still, it&#x27;s not a storage service like S3 so geo-redundancy plays a smaller role. We do plan on building out other datacenters in the future, but since we&#x27;re bootstrapped, we have to do that when the time is right, otherwise it would be very easy to over-extend ourselves and start losing money. edit -&gt; I ignored your Backblaze dev question, sorry.

I forget exactly what it was but it was something like &quot;Java Python Flash Linux game developer&quot; or whatever. I had learned about this from an out-of-the-blue client lead who emailed me. I was shocked when he said that&#x27;s how he found me. I then went around to about a dozen different computers, different types, different geo locations in my state, both auth&#x27;ed and anonymous, and sure enough I always came up as top result, first page. It was... an awesome time to be taking on contract&#x2F;consulting work, let me tell you. So many more leads coming in than before. Not enough hours in the week&#x2F;month to help them, had to turn down otherwise interesting gigs. Then it came to an end. Rug pulled out.

Lesson (one anyway): that&#x27;s a huge eyeball funnel. bazillions of people doing searches. even getting a tiny slice of it means tons of eyeballs stumbling upon you. quality is important, of course, being great at what you do, having the right leads, a good fit, avail, etc. But quantity?

    "text": "If Rosetta had an operations crew nearby - even just one person - the cost of the mission would have been, what, 100x greater? Surely enough more expensive to pay for multiple robotic probes. Total mission cost for Rosetta = 1.4 billion Euros. It costs something like $50,000&#x2F;kg for GEO, so I&#x27;ll use that as the baseline. The Orion capsule weighs 21 tons and the Deep Space Habitat at least 50 tons. Add one person and the 5 kg of consumables per day, for a mission of 300 days, gives another 2 tons. That&#x27;s $3 billion already, or 2.4 billion Euros. Now add the development costs, support staff, communications, etc. and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to send a small fleet of redundant probes than to send a single human. To double check, an Orion capture of an asteroid in an orbit close to Earth&#x27;s is $2.6 billion (see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orion_%28spacecraft%29#Explorat... ), again, excluding development costs. In any case, we have no way to put a human on the same orbit as a comet, much less return the human safely to Earth, so only a robot mission is possible.",

    "text": "(I&#x27;m the author&#x2F;founder.) Old one did distributed breadth-first graph exploration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zerotier&#x2F;ZeroTierOne&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OLD-Multicast-A... It was nifty and cool and worked pretty well for small to mid tier stuff, but biggest disadvantages in practice were: (1) Peers seem to drop the potato more often than I predicted when I simulated it, leading to a lot of truncated propagations. It also has no geo-awareness, so if your propagation graph goes through sub-Saharan Africa you&#x27;re likely to see a lot of packet loss. I think my simulations implicitly assumed all high-end first-world broadband links, when reality includes the whole world and a lot of slow&#x2F;crummy cellular. (2) High latency, which caused problems for people who wanted low-latency multicast for SDN-type applications (enterprise stuff). In the beginning I never considered those applications, but they&#x27;re emerging as a major user base. (3) Imposed a high CPU cost, since to prevent flooding every packet had to be cryptographically signed by its originating node. That&#x27;s a lot of ECC256 signatures and verifications. (4) Mobile-unfriendly, since mobile devices really want to be able to enter long-term hibernation and not have to wake to help others propagate their multicasts. Mobile might even want to turn off most multicast, only allowing ARP and NDP or even emulating these for no multicast at all. (Currently working on iOS and Android ZT1 ports.) This also applies to tiny low power embedded devices, and I&#x27;ve had some interest from Internet-of-things experimenters. There&#x27;s no write-up on the new algorithm yet, but it&#x27;s basically sender-side replication with lazy but deterministic gathering. It gathers recipients up to the limit from supernodes and from peers. (In reality supernodes are peers-- they&#x27;re merely peers designated as such.) I remember initially passing on that idea since I was afraid it would be too heavy on the sender, but observing real traffic flows shows that in aggregate the multicast traffic load ends up close to the same. Sender-side replication is also inherently fair -- sender pays the price -- so you don&#x27;t need such heavy signature&#x2F;verification checks to ensure that somebody can&#x27;t flood the network. This way it&#x27;s no easier to flood with multicast than with unicast. (Obviously anyone can DDOS but that&#x27;s another matter.) In the longer term I plan to add some support for merging of multicasts going to the same local network or site, but I&#x27;m not sure how yet... it&#x27;s probably going to intersect with R&amp;D work I&#x27;m doing right now on enterprise supernode federation for SDN applications and similar stuff.",

    "text": "Hi MichaelGG, I am a Program Manager for Azure Search and as curiousDog mentioned, yes along with DocumentDB, we also announced Azure Search which is a PaaS based full text search service. We actually leverage ElasticSearch at the core of this service and as chippy says about spatial search, we do have the ability to provide a pretty solid geo-spatial search capability thanks to Elastic Search and Lucene. To nemothekids&#x27;s point, is it very unlikely that we will offer this as a local (non-hosted) version because we found that although ElasticSearch is awesome, one of the common complaints many admin&#x27;s have is the complexity around managing systems such as ElasticSearch&#x2F;SOLR&#x2F;Lucene at high scale and how difficult it is to implement more advanced search capabilities such as tuning and relevancy. Those are areas we think we can add a lot of value being a fully managed service. Longer term, we think this will also allow us to bring even more value on top of search by adding in other Microsoft technologies. For example, we could tie in Bing Maps to allow you to easily tie in reverse geo-coding right into your search. Or perhaps allow you to leverage Bing&#x27;s synonym list so that you could allow people to search yet find results that are synonyms to commonly searched words (i.e., user types in shoes, but in your content it is referred to as footwear). Multi-language support is actually one of the big things we want to tackle in the short term and we believe that the NLP from Office will really help jump start us with this. Liam",

In fact, the last two places I worked had distinct government and commercial divisions (where I ran the commercial divisions). That said, I&#x27;ve built and run several security consulting practices in the DC area, and consequently have done hiring interviews for dozens of people who were NSA employees (1 of which we ended up hiring). Absolutely none of them have even the slightest apprehension about the nature of the work they were doing (so much as they were able to comment about it during interviews). In fact, prior to the Snowden leaks, the NSA was pretty much at the bottom of my list for government agencies doing shit I disliked. They have a pretty clear scope and charter (which we&#x27;ve come to learn has been muddied). But no one I&#x27;ve talked to, either who works there or works at a contractor in the DIB, thinks they&#x27;ve done anything wrong. Did you read those batshit NSA talking points that came out yesterday from Al Jazeera&#x27;s FOIA request? They believe those things. They think they&#x27;re doing important, valuable work to protect the country. I can only imagine that internally within NSA there has been dissent about some of the stuff that&#x27;s come out. Maybe people have resigned over it, maybe they&#x27;ve sent strongly-worded emails to their bosses. I really hope there was a great deal of dissent about the &quot;intentionally fuck up crypto standards that we push to other branches of the government&quot;, but I doubt we&#x27;ll ever hear much about it. Your questions could just as easily refer to people who work on SEO spam, or targeted advertisements (I&#x27;m not saying those things are equivalent, but they&#x27;re also jobs I&#x27;ve heard people on here posturing morally about).",

    "text": "Ok, this guy is using a couple of methods off BlackHatWorld (Probably the biggest SEO forum around if you haven&#x27;t heard of it) So essentially this guy is building this site, ranking it in Google using the churn &#x27;n Burn method, then once its ranking well he&#x27;ll contact local business saying he can link to them in return for a fee. Even though the domain is 6 months old, if you look at ahrefs this guy has 33k backlinks to the homepage. Google had a major SEO update on October 4th which essentially fucked up their algorithm more than it already was. This churn &#x27;n burn method means that you spam out a zillion backlinks and you will rank really well until the next Google update comes along (which is around 3-4 months) You could do this in the previous Google update (Penguin 2.1) and I thought Google would fix this but they just made it easier. This is a good example of the method: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackhatworld.com&#x2F;blackhat-seo&#x2F;black-hat-seo&#x2F;5769... (This was the one of the guys that essentially figured out this method from what I can tell) So with this new Google update, they are getting rid of some of the spammy sites, but more spam sites just taken their places in the rankings. Now they are focusing on the amount of content on your site rather than the backlinks. So now 10 year old sites with hundreds of legitimate, high authority backlinks are getting outranked but spammy sites with 14 backlinks and 300 gibberish articles. I&#x27;ve also been reading that with local Google searches, you get results from completely different countries. For example, people in the UK were reporting that they were getting results from sites in Russia, Argentina and New Zealand instead of UK results. I don&#x27;t think this happens as much in America from what I know. So I&#x27;m guessing Google is eventually going to iron out these problems, but it&#x27;s a battleground at the moment. If you do get outranked by this guy, make a video with your keywords in the title, same with a Facebook and LinkedIn page and then buy a bunch of backlinks off Fiverr. They should outrank pretty much any other website in a matter of days.",

    "text": "In SEO, the user makes an overt action (search) and the ranking of search then can affects what the user sees. We&#x27;ve grown to accept that. In social-graph-optimisation the overt act is much higher granularity - its to follow &#x2F; friend another person. So the game is to join as many graphs as possible, or to find the graph of the person you want, and join that. I think this granularity problem will severely limit the acceptance of SEO-for-social-graphs. Seo right now works because it is possible to finesse at the right granularity level as a function of a users action. Geo-location work will also massively help - but social is effectively painting ads onto my friends T-Shirts in the hope I will read them. I struggle to see the next fine grained action (*) We need a better term than social media, because this is all just variations on an individual has their own webspace, and updates that space regularly, plus a central scraping service to let others know. The important bit is that Ts&amp;Cs play less of a &quot;real&quot; part in this than might seem true - essentially the Ts&amp;Cs cover FB&#x2F;Twitter business model, and less the privacy of the user.",

The widget will cost you 1000 bucks&quot; Get away from selling your time please. Sell something else, sell a feature, sell a widget, sell a service. As a &quot;bum on seat&quot; I have charged by the hour, the day, the week or even a month. And each an every time I was expected to, contracted to do 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I was an employee. I could not supply them a simple single product, custom built for them because I had to wade through meetings and politics and inertia and everything else we all know and love. They were too disorganised, too chaotic, too out of control to know what they wanted at a level below &quot;months of work from dozens of people&quot;, and so the ride continued. This is where the Internet is opening up new opportunities - because now it is dismantling (read automating) traditional marketing and even management . One guy can reach a global audience with good SEO, and one group of people can do away with 80% of industrial world management (including geo-co-location). And all that will dismantle the chaotic crazy world of contractors selling their time inside corporations who need software but are not able to deal with the implications. The contracting world will look very different in ten years. It will look a lot like what patio11 is selling. So, stop selling your time - instead sell a packet of something, for about the price of a week of your time, to do something that will take about a week of your time. It looks a lot like selling a week of your time, except that * it does not say so in the contract * it is something you can and will automate. Selling a product is 80%+ automated and 20% custom. Selling a productised-consult is 20% automated and 80% custom. The more that 80% dives down, the more profit you make in your &quot;week&quot;. However the more it looks like a product, the less you can charge :-) Do I care that my accountant only spends an hour looking over an annual return he got by pressing a button, yet charges a grand? No, because I make up for it on chats over coffee and the knowledge that he would catch the horror of a mistake and fix it. No horror, good for him.

Read it back to yourself: &#62; Search Engine Optimization They're already liars. They aren't optimizing anybody's search engine. They're optimizing HTML so that it can be easily parsed and crawled, but that doesn't sound as sexy. It's marketing hocus pocus, tantamount to chart reading for day traders in the stock market. Just like chart readers, gazing into the Rorschach blots of spikes and trends in the stock market, they don't truly understand, and can't honestly answer to, how their composite numbers tie back to reality. They honestly have no control over the search engines they claim to optimize for, and have only an outsider's probed understanding of the internal workings of the search engines they target. The exception to this is when former employees of search engines are hired as consultants at these places that claim to offer these services, but honestly aside from that sort of intra-industry incest, what else do they have to offer? SEO as a term is a throwback to the late 90's when a lot of people didn't really understand what search engines do, and got sold on a trend. Yes, yes, robots.txt. Yes, unobtrusive JavaScript. Yes, structure your DOM in a well-organized, logical manner. Yes, simplify unauthenticated link URLs, and try to correlate references semantically. Yes, use the alt, title and name attributes, to further orient semantics. I get it, okay. Y'know, these same ideas overlap well-enough with accessibility standards. Anything beyond this kind of coding practice is really either link spam, or simple tasks like requesting that a search engine crawl your domain. And that's a marketing campaign. Nothing is being optimized. Can I stop putting this archaic buzzword on my resume? I don't optimize search engines, and unless you're posting an ad for a position at one, neither do you.

They aren't offering a guide for tricking anything, they're offering a guide about how to properly structure your site so that it is easily crawlable and identifiable by their spiders so searchers can query for what you have to offer. The core purpose of SEO is to do exactly what you said here: \"The whole premise of the open web is that natural selection would allow rich information to be filtered through because it is good.\" It's called Search Engine OPTIMIZATION for a reason. The goal is to build very well structured sites by following specific sets of best practices. Sure, there are lots of spammers out there. But just like a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't necessarily a square, a spammer is an SEO but an SEO isn't necessarily a spammer.

    "text": "1. Are you confusing SEO for visibility? SEO == Search Engine Optimization. Google, Bing, and Yahoo didn't even crack 0.5% of your referral sites. If you're not getting traffic from search engines then you're not optimized and ranking for stuff when someone searches. That has nothing to do with the technical stuff like tags and more to do with the actual content. Looking at the data you provide, Hacker News accounts for almost 1/2 your visits, 1/4 on Twitter, then everything else. (BTW, you don't have % of NEW visits in your post which is a more interesting number to read.) The half life of content on Twitter is 3 hours ( http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/ ) which means you're only really visible for, at best, 1 day. Promotion on Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are great but, if I were a writer, I would want to see long-term visibility to new readers where I'm NOT promoting yourself. ... Like Google searches. Assume people are looking to compare Techstars with something else. The #1 search, according to Google Instant search, for \"techstars vs (something)\" is \"techstars vs y combinator\" If your post \"Given The Opportunity: Should You Do TechStars or YC\" showed up on the first page of Google then I would say you've been able to achieve great visibility without SEO. ..... But you don't even show up in the first 5 pages. So, I think you've confused Search Engine Optimization with visibility. (common mistake, actually) ------------ Let's look at your data.... You didn't analyse or provide any insight, which is what I think people should DO with data. (Full disclosure: I'm work in the analytics department for my company. I research and write code to answer these kinds of questions for clients) 2. Are people actually reading your blog? It says currently that the average pages per visit is about 2 and they're spending 0:52 seconds on your blog. The average adult reads 250-300 words every minute. ( http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy ) At a glance you average 150-200 word posts. Does that mean they're only reading half of the second page they go to (What is the time on page for second page?) What is the second page? Is it the home page or another blog post? The data you provide doesn't help to answer that. You didn't mention your \"% of Exits\". A bounce rate, by definition, is always visits that only visited one page and left. Therefore, \"% of Bounce rate\" isn't a good metric to look at for you because your average pages per visit is over 1. \"% of Exits\" sorted by the URL of the page would give you insight into your readers. If your \"% of Exits\" on your home page is really high, then it may mean your readers aren't finding anything interesting to read. Conversely, if the \"% of Exits\" is usually a blog post, that's OK, especially if it's their second page, it means they may have read two posts then left. ------------ 3. Are you gaining new readers / are old readers coming back? You said that the percentage of new visits is 70%. Over the past year is that increasing, decreasing, or going all over the place? What about \"% of returning visits?\" If you're trying to go after new readers, great job. I would think making sure they return for more later is also important. I don't think you really want to be a one hit wonder. ------------ 4. Are your readers subscribing to your mailing list? It's on the right side of every page, so I'm guessing you want to make sure people notice it. Nobody wants spam, so if they subscribe you're almost guaranteed they like what you're writing. Are visitors subscribing to your mailing list? Is that number increasing? It's a good thing if they are.",

The economists were asked to rank proposals according to how much good they would do in alleviating existing world problems. The premise is a limited budget roughly based on 'aid budgets'. I think climate change should have been left outside of what they were looking at altogether for lots of reasons. The projects are too uncertain to be ranked. Putting an extra $1b towards existing climate change projects may result in absolutely no effect on climate change. We are talking about risky, expensive projects. An economist doesn't really know if a propaganda campaign to convince americans or Chinese to sign some deal is better then some geo-engineering technology project to directly cool the earth. It is outside the realm of what smart economists are good at. - It is coming out of different pockets. Climate change affects rich countries too. It is self interested spending. Certainly, there are tragedy of the commons like problems. But it is still in the interest of those spending to spend. - The effects of climate change are uncertain and indirect. One of the potential climate change issues is decreased glacial melt in India resulting in less summer river flows in to Pakistan. India is entitled (by treaty) to a fixed (in litres) amount of water. Pakistan needs this water to grow food without which it will be in famine. This could result in, mass refuge crisis, nuclear war, etc. It is virtually impossible to link something like that directly to an increase or decrease of $500m in spending by some NGO. *But... If you are a millionaire or in charge of an NGO or a foreign spending budget or give money to a poverty related charity, the Copenhagen Consensus seems like an important list to consider. If decide to act against its recommendations, at least have a reason.",

I just have to rewrite a few things (use postal codes instead of a giant geo database) and a few others that will actually help the application out.
