    "text": "Folks, we’ve all been there... you find a cool Chrome extension, go to install it, and then you see the warning: &quot;This extension can read and change all your data on all websites.&quot; Is it a technical necessity? Or is it a keylogger sending your bank logins to a server in a basement somewhere? Unless you&#x27;re a developer willing to manually download and decompile the .crx file, you’re just guessing. I got tired of that &quot;blind trust&quot; model and built an AI-powered security scanner that goes through the actual code of every extension on the store: ChromeBoard.com. What ChromeBoard Does: - Full Source Code Analysis: We don’t just read the description; we scan the entire codebase. - Plain English Reports: We explain permissions in simple terms. No &quot;trust scores&quot;—just the facts so you can decide. - Network Mapping: We identify every external server your data is sent to. - Flagging Dangerous Patterns: Our AI detects eval(), obfuscation, crypto-mining, and potential keyloggers. - Version Comparisons: See exactly what changed (or what was added) between updates. - Auto-Rescans: We trigger a new scan whenever an extension updates. The Vision: Why this matters Right now, each scan takes about 2 minutes. Why? Because I’m running this entire operation on a single RTX 4090 using a local Qwen3-Coder-30B model. I’m doing this locally because: - Privacy: I refuse to send extension code to some cheap no-privacy third-party AI APIs. - Cost: I can’t afford $50k&#x2F;month in inference fees for 250k+ extensions. The site has only been live for two days, but the goal is to make this the &quot;Carfax&quot; of the Chrome Ecosystem. - For Users: A &quot;check before you install&quot; report that actually makes sense. - For Developers: A way to get &quot;Verified Trust&quot; signals to drive adoption. - For Enterprises: A third-party vetting tool for IT admins to secure their org. The &quot;Ask&quot;: Help me scale this I’ve reached the limit of what a single local GPU can do. I am looking for Cloud AI&#x2F;Inference sponsors to help me move this from &quot;side project speed&quot; to &quot;ecosystem speed.&quot; With the right compute partners, I could scan 1,000x faster, provide real-time alerts when a behavior changes, and open up an API for other security tools. If you represent a cloud provider or AI platform, here is why you want to be the engine behind ChromeBoard: - Massive Visibility: Your brand on every security report (&quot;Powered by...&quot;). - High Volume: A sustained, high-integrity API flow through your stack. - The &quot;Good Guy&quot; Factor: You’re helping secure the browsers of millions of people. I’m just one dev who got tired of clicking &quot;Install&quot; and praying. If you’re a dev, an admin, or just hate malware, check out the site and let me know: Which extension should I scan next? Check it out: ChromeBoard.com",

Each task runs in a single agent context (one responsibility, clear scope), and when the window fills up, the system automatically rotates: writes a structured handover, clears, and resumes in a fresh window. The key distinction: sub-agents run within a parent context with shared state (black box). My approach uses independent parallel agents (separate terminals, separate context windows) that report back to an orchestrator. Large tasks get split into smaller dispatches upfront — each scoped to fit a single context window. The orchestrator can dispatch research to 3 agents in parallel, collect their outputs, then dispatch a synthesis task to a single agent that merges the findings. So it&#x27;s not &quot;one context window for everything&quot; — it&#x27;s right-sized tasks with full observability per agent, and a governance layer managing the sequence and merging results.",

If these companies are the new town square then make a real online town square run by the government people can use if they so choose and then break up the monopolies that are destroying the fabric of all the societies on the globe. We never in a million years should have allowed these companies to establish global scale communications platforms without the ability to properly moderate them with human intervention and that’s not even to speak of the actual nefarious intent they possess to drive engagement and the anti democratic techno feudalist sickening shit we see from their CEOs like Thiel et al.

The organizations issuing those IDs, governments, are the ones making the bot armies. Just try to discuss anything about Russia, or how bad some specific decision of the Chinese CCP is. Or, if you&#x27;re so inclined: think about how having this in the US would mean Trump would be authorizing bot armies.

    "text": "We are missing accessible cryptographic infrastructure for human identity verification. For age verification specifically, the only information that services need proof of is that the users age is above a certain threshold. i.e. that the user is 14 years or older. But in order to make this determination, we see services asking for government ID (which many 14-year-olds do not have), or for invasive face scans. These methods provide far more data than necessary. What the service needs to &quot;prove&quot; in this case is three things: 1. that the user meets the age predicate 2. that the identity used to meet the age predicate is validated by some authority 3. that the identity is not being reused across many accounts All the technologies exist for this, we just haven&#x27;t put them together usefully. Zero knowledge proofs, like Groth16 or STARKs allow for statements about data to be validated externally without revealing the data itself. These are difficult for engineers to use, let alone consumers. Big opportunity for someone to build an authority here.",

Getting hung up on unlinkable sessions is missing the forest for the trees. At this point I think the challenge has less to do with the crypto primitives and more to do with building infrastructure that hides 100% of the complexity of identity validation from users. My state already has a gov&#x27;t ID that can be added to an apple wallet. Extending that to support proofs about identity without requiring users to unmask huge amounts of personal information would be valuable in its own right.",

There are many powerful interests that support this model: - Governments benefit from easier monitoring and enforcement. - The advertising industry prefers verified identities for better targeting. - Social media companies gain more reliable data and engagement. - Online shopping companies can reduce fraud and increase tracking. - Many SaaS companies would also welcome stronger identity verification. In short, anonymity is not very profitable, and governments often favor identification because it increases oversight and control. Of course, this leads to political debate. Some point out that voting often does not require ID, while accessing online services does. The usual argument is that voting is a constitutional right. However, one could argue that access to the internet has become a fundamental part of modern life as well. It may not be explicitly written into the Constitution, but in practice it functions as an essential right in today’s society.",

It seems incredibly obvious mechanism but I&#x27;ve explained it to people, and it takes a few times for it to really sink in and become a specific mental model for how they see the world.",

If that&#x27;s criminalized (like alcohol), it will happen too often to prosecute (much more frequently than alcohol, which is rarely prosecuted anyways). I don&#x27;t see a solution that isn&#x27;t a fundamental culture shift. If there&#x27;s a fundamental culture shift, there&#x27;s an easy way to prevent children from using the internet: - Don&#x27;t give them an unlocked device until they&#x27;re adults - &quot;Locked&quot; devices and accounts have a whitelist of data and websites verified by some organization to be age-appropriate (this may include sites that allow uploads and even subdomains, as long as they&#x27;re checked on upload) The only legal change necessary is to prevent selling unlocked devices without ID. Parents would take their devices from children and form locked software and whitelisting organizations.",

Discussions about kids and technology on HN are very weird to me these days because so many commenters have seemingly forgotten what it’s like to be a kid with technology.

Exactly the same way that kids used in former days to get cigarettes or alcohol: simply ask a friend or a sibling. By the way: the owners of the &quot;well-known&quot; beverage shops made their own rules, which were in some sense more strict, but in other ways less strict than the laws: For example some small shop in Germany sold beverages with little alcohol to basically everybody who did not look suspicious, but was insanely strict on selling cigarettes: even if the buyer was sufficiently old (which was in doubt strictly checked), the owner made serious attempts to refuse selling cigarettes if he had the slightest suspicion that the cigarettes were actually bought for some younger person. In other words: if you attempted to buy cigarettes, you were treated like a suspect if the owner knew that you had younger friends (and the owner knew this very well).",

Gee, I wonder if the executives who are suspected of doing such things haven&#x27;t spent the last 100 years building the infrastructure necessary to avoid charges, let alone jail time? Large corporate legal departments, wink-wink-nudge-nudge command and control hierarchies where nothing incriminating is ever put into writing, voluminous intra-office communications that bury even the circumstantial evidence so deeply no jury could understand it even if the plaintiffs&#x2F;state could uncover it, etc. Anyone over the age of 12 that thinks corporate entities can be made to be accountable in a meaningful way is more than naive. They are cognitively defective. Or is it that you realize they can&#x27;t be held accountable but you&#x27;d rather maintain the status quo than contemplate a country which abolished them and enforced that all business was the conducted by sole proprietorships and (small-n) partnerships?",

    "text": "I run multiple content-heavy sites and got tired of one thing: there was no deterministic way to validate with the AI agent whether my content was actually optimized. Not &quot;probably fine&quot; — actually checked against concrete rules, both for traditional search and for AI search engines. SEO linters exist, but they&#x27;re either paid SaaS, not automatable, or ignore the structural patterns that LLMs use when deciding what to cite. So I built one. geo-lint is a CLI with 92 rules: 32 SEO (table stakes — titles, descriptions, headings, slugs, canonical URLs, schema, the works), 35 GEO rules specifically for AI citation readiness, 14 content quality checks inspired by Yoast, and the rest for technical and i18n validation. We extensively researched the current state of GEO and AEO to make sure the rules reflect what actually gets content cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — not outdated advice. The design principle: the linter is deterministic, the AI agent is creative. Same content in, same violations out, every time. The agent does the fixing. In practice, I install it in a project, paste one prompt into Claude Code or Cursor: Run npx geo-lint --format=json, fix every violation using the suggestion field, re-run until the output is []. And walk away. The agent reads the JSON violations, edits the files, re-lints, loops — no manual input. When it finishes, the content is validated for both traditional search ranking and AI citation. One command, both outcomes, across an entire site. Every rule outputs a machine-readable suggestion field that tells the agent exactly what to change. The JSON has no formatting, no ANSI colors — pure structured data. Works with Markdown&#x2F;MDX out of the box, extensible to Astro, HTML, or any CMS via custom adapters. This is extracted from the toolchain I use on production client content at my agency. MIT licensed, zero peer dependencies, TypeScript. Happy to answer questions about GEO patterns, what makes content citable by LLMs, or how the agentic loop works in practice.",

    "text": "Tesla claims that their cameras use &quot;photon counting&quot; and that this lets them see well in the dark, in fog, in heavy rain, and when facing bright lights like the sun. Photon counting is a real thing [1] but that&#x27;s not what Tesla claims to be doing. I cannot tell if what they are doing is something actually effective that they should have called something other than &quot;photon counting&quot; or just the usual Musk exaggerations. Anyone here familiar with the relevant fields who can say which it is? Here&#x27;s what they claim, as summarized by whatever it is Google uses for their &quot;AI Overview&quot;. &gt; Tesla photon counting is an advanced, raw-data approach to camera imaging for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), where sensors detect and count individual light particles (photons) rather than processing aggregate image intensity. By removing traditional image processing filters and directly passing raw pixel data to neural networks, Tesla improves dynamic range, enabling better vision in low light and high-contrast scenarios. It says these are the key aspects: &gt; Direct Data Processing: Instead of relying on image signal processors (ISPs) to create a human-friendly picture, Tesla feeds raw sensor data directly into the neural network, allowing the system to detect subtle light variations and near-IR (infrared) light. &gt; Improved Dynamic Range: This approach allows the system to see in the dark exceptionally well by not losing information to standard image compression or exposure adjustments. &gt; Increased Sensitivity: By operating at the single-photon level, the system achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio, effectively &quot;seeing in the dark&quot;. &gt; Elimination of Exposure Limitations: The technique helps mitigate issues like sun glare, allowing for better visibility in extreme lighting conditions. &gt; Neural Network Training: The raw, unfiltered data is used to train Tesla&#x27;s neural networks, allowing for more robust, high-fidelity perception in complex, real-world driving environments.

While 50 meters is a very short distance, the car must be present at the car wash to be cleaned, according to LinkedIn users [1]. Walking would leave your car at home, defeating the purpose of the trip, notes another user. Why Drive: The car needs to be at the location to be cleaned. It&#x27;s only a few seconds away, and you can simply drive it there and back, says a Hacker News user. [2] Why Not to Walk: Walking there means the car stays home, as noted in a post. [3] The best option is to start the engine, drive the 50 meters, and let the car get washed. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ramar_i-saw-this-llm-failure-...

On most North American VCRs, that would mean selecting either output channel 3 or 4. For larger coverage areas, cut two dipole antennas to the appropriate size for the selected channel (one antenna for TX, one for RX). If you were to put a low noise VHF-LO amp inline between the VCR output and the TX antenna, you&#x27;d be able to cover a much larger area, but would probably have legal issues with governmental authorities in charge of telecommunication spectrum.",

React uses an outdated rendering method that has now been surpassed by many better frameworks. Svelte&#x2F;Sveltekit, Vue, and Qwik are the best examples. People relying on bloated React packages is obviously not great but that is nothing to do with javascript itself. The JS engines are all relatively fast now. And the document model of the current web provides major accessibility to both humans and search tools like SEO and GEO. JS is not my favorite language. I would rather the web was based on a statically typed language that had better error handling practices like Go. But this will most likely not happen any time soon as it would require every level of the ecosystem to adapt. Browsers, Frameworks, Developers etc. Google would have to take the lead and implement this in chrome then enough developers would have to build sites using it and force safari and firefox to comply. It just isn&#x27;t feasible. If you want faster webapps just switch to sveltekit or vue or qwik. But often the ones choosing the framework for the project have not written much code in years, they know react is as safe option and used by everyone else so they follow along, if it gets slow its a &quot;bug&quot; causing it as they built apps that were &quot;good enough&quot; before using it.",

    "text": "I’m building an AI search optimization product and wanted to apply the same principles internally: fix content architecture before launch instead of correcting problems after users — or AI systems — struggle to understand it. To do this, I created a Python CLI tool that analyzes semantic structure using vector embeddings. It parses markdown files, generates embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI), computes cosine similarity, runs k-means clustering, detects redundancy and semantic gaps, and produces visualizations like heatmaps, dendrograms, and UMAP projections. The stack includes Python 3.12, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, UMAP, and Plotly, with embedding caching for speed. Analysis Overview: The site contains 25 pages (~12.9k words) across features, concepts, use cases, and resources. No stub pages were found. Topic coherence (measured via average similarity between sections) ranged from 0.73 to 0.93, with most pages between 0.78–0.88. Lower coherence wasn’t necessarily bad — the Proof Engine page scored lower because it intentionally covers many subtopics. Semantic redundancy showed only one pair above 0.85 similarity, both intentional cross-link sections. Earlier, I removed two index pages with 85%+ similarity to parent pages, flattening navigation from three layers to two. No semantic gaps were detected; all pages were well connected. Hub analysis confirmed that Home, Learn, and the AEO Playbook act as central nodes, matching the intended architecture of concepts → applications → tools. Heatmap clustering revealed: * Concept pages: 0.65–0.80 similarity * Feature pages: 0.45–0.65 similarity * Use cases: 0.70–0.79 similarity Embeddings were chosen over keyword analysis because they capture meaning rather than wording, detecting paraphrased overlap and relationships relevant to AI retrieval systems. Limitations include model sensitivity, arbitrary cluster counts, and coherence scores that don’t fully account for intentional structure. Planned improvements include entity coverage analysis, competitor comparisons, and query-simulation testing. The entire process took under a minute but prevented structural issues that could cause discoverability problems later. Running semantic analysis pre-launch helped validate architecture, reduce duplication, and ensure content works for both humans and AI retrieval systems.",

    "text": "Been building multi-agent systems for the past few months and keep running into the same problem: agent regressions that no traditional test catches. Wrote up the failure modes I&#x27;ve actually seen. The short version: Skill bloat is the sneaky one. You add tools over time, each makes sense individually, then at 30+ tools the agent starts picking wrong ones. Anthropic&#x27;s team wrote about this too. A single Playwright MCP server burns 11.7K tokens on tool definitions alone, included in every request whether you use them or not. Context rot caught me off guard. Chroma measured 18 LLMs and found 11&#x2F;12 drop below 50% performance at just 32K tokens. We had a bug where adding a new capability pushed an older instruction into the &quot;lost in the middle&quot; zone. Took two days to figure out why an unrelated feature degraded. The scariest one is when a prompt tweak makes your agent stop saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and start confidently making things up. Surface metrics go up. Accuracy goes down. Google&#x27;s AI Overviews had this problem at scale. Also covers cost creep (same traffic, 40% higher bill, nobody has a cost gate in CI&#x2F;CD), multi-agent cascade failures (Berkeley&#x27;s MAST paper found 14 failure modes across 7 frameworks, ChatDev hit 33% correctness), and model updates breaking things you didn&#x27;t touch. We have 20 years of great tooling for deterministic regression. For probabilistic regression we have basically nothing.",

But the article claims the state already knew 50% of the daycares claiming its aid were frauds (this is quite debatable, don&#x27;t take it as fact). Presumably that&#x27;s 50% of hundreds or maybe thousands of daycares. If blue fish were much rarer in the pond, i.e. lower percentage of daycares defrauding the government, you&#x27;d be considered a savant for fishing once and pulling out nine blue fish... but if the pond has thousands of fish and 50% are blue, it looks a lot less impressive.",

    "text": "Being able to sing on pitch is more music training than voice training. Music can be trained in any voice pretty much. As for vocal range - it is one of the easiest ones to improve! Simple daily drills can get you there. It&#x27;s the same for simple voice quality things like learning to sing from your chest&#x2F;diaphragm rather than just a head&#x2F;nasal voice. As for having an &quot;aesthetic voice&quot;, the steps needed is is extremely specific to each individual and each trainer. Both of you will &quot;path&quot; towards something that will be aesthetic for you and also achievable. Musicians e.g do this to adapt themselves to the &quot;beloved&quot; voice of their target industry. For an example, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=arijit+singh+voice+transform... - the AI overview is a pretty decent summary with links to original source. Bollywood really likes love songs to be in husky male voices, so he adapted to that. You don&#x27;t have to do all that of course, but a small % of similar work will get you to &quot;aesthetic&quot; territory. Listening to lots of vocal music (preferably with very light accompaniment) also helps a looot. We are really good at imitation.",

But the interesting bit of the observation is, almost entirely, the base rate of the pond. And I think journalism and civil society should do some genuine soul-searching on how we knew—knew—the state of that pond, but didn’t consider it particularly important or newsworthy until someone started fishing on camera.

We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to help scale our data ingestion pipelines and LLM-based evaluation systems. You’ll be working on the core engine that benchmarks brand mentions against competitors across various model architectures. We are a small, results-driven team focused on high-intent lead generation for SaaS. If you&#x27;re interested in the intersection of search behavior and automated content strategy, we’d love to hear from you. I am the founder and will be personally reviewing and responding to all applications. Contact: careers@gracker.ai",

GEO tools do not inject prompts or control inference. They systematically reshape the external content corpus from which large language models synthesize answers. When AI-generated representations are materially relied upon in regulated decisions, this practice creates an evidentiary gap: outcomes can influence judgment without producing reconstructable, auditable records explaining why those outcomes prevailed. This is not a claim of illegality. It is a governance lag.",

Each one contains the framework references, quality rules, and logic required to generate professional-grade output without the typical &quot;AI fluff.&quot; The core philosophy here is &quot;No Fluff.&quot; I’ve hard-coded rules into the system instructions to prevent the &quot;As an AI language model...&quot; intros and the &quot;I hope this helps!&quot; outros. It goes straight to the substantive content. Each Skill is a single Markdown file. I use Markdown because LLMs parse the hierarchy of headers and bullet points better than flat text. The prompts are designed to be &quot;context-aware,&quot; meaning they infer whether the business is B2B or B2C based on the initial brief without requiring manual toggles. The library is organized by function: STRATEGY Buyer Persona: 400+ line personas with 10 psychological sections. Market Positioning: Competitive alternatives and SWOT frameworks. Value Proposition: Feature -&gt; Capability -&gt; Benefit -&gt; Outcome ladders. GTM Strategy: Full plans including channels and timelines. ADVERTISING Google&#x2F;Meta Campaigns: Complete with hook formulas and audience specs. Ad Copy: 15+ variations using psychological triggers. A&#x2F;B Testing: Structured hypothesis and measurement frameworks. CONTENT &amp; SEO LLM Optimization: Strategies for visibility in AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity). SEO Strategy: Keyword research and link-building plans. Content Strategy: Pillar-cluster models with editorial calendars. COPY &amp; WEBSITE Landing Pages: Using StoryBrand and PAS frameworks. Headlines: 20+ variations using AIDA and PAS formulas. Homepage Audit: Conversion optimization with prioritized fixes. SALES &amp; EMAIL Email Sequences: 5-10 stage nurture flows with subject A&#x2F;B variants. Sales Scripts: Discovery, demo, and objection handling. HOW TO USE: Download the .md file for a skill (maestrix.ai&#x2F;skills). Upload it to Claude (via Projects or the Skills capability). Provide your basic business info. The system triggers the logic automatically.",

    "text": "That&#x27;s not what this is about. HTTPS is the name of a protocol, which is mostly used to make the World Wide Web work, but we do lots of other things with it, such as DNS-over-HTTPS aka DoH. However HTTPS is also the name of a type of DNS record, this record contains everything you need to best reach the named HTTPS (protocol) server, and this is the type of record your parent didn&#x27;t previously know about In the boring case, say, 20 years ago, when you type https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.name&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;hats.html into a web browser your browser goes &quot;Huh, HTTPS to some.name. OK, I will find out the IPv4 address of some.name, and it makes a DNS query asking A? some.name. The DNS server answers with an IPv4 address, and then as the browser connects securely to that IP address, it asks to talk to some.name, and if the remote host can prove it is some.name, the browser says it wants &#x2F;stuff&#x2F;hats.html Notice we have to tell the remote server who we hope they are - and it so happens eavesdroppers can listen in on this. This means Bad Guys can see that you wanted to visit some.name. They can&#x27;t see that you wanted to read the document about hats, but they might be able to guess that from context, and wouldn&#x27;t you rather they didn&#x27;t know more than they need to? With the HTTPS record, your web browser asks (over secure DNS if you have it) HTTPS? some.name and, maybe it gets a positive answer. If it does, the answer tells it not only where to try to connect, but also it can choose to provide instructions for a cover name to always use, and how to encrypt the real name, this is part of Encrypted Client Hello (or ECH) Then the web server tells the server that it wants to talk to the cover name and it provides an encrypted version of some.name. Eavesdroppers can&#x27;t decrypt that, so if many people share the same endpoints then eavesdropper can&#x27;t tell which site you were visiting. Now, if the server only contains documents about hats, this doesn&#x27;t stop the Secret Hat Police from concluding that everybody connecting to that server is a Hat Pervert and needs to go to Hat Jail. But if you&#x27;re a bulk host then you force such organisations to choose, they can enforce their rules equally for everything (You wanted to read News about Chickens? Too bad, Hat Jail for you) or they can accept that actually they don&#x27;t know what people are reading (if this seems crazy, keep in mind that&#x27;s how US Post worked for many years after Comstock failed, if you get a brown paper package posted to you, well, it&#x27;s your business what is in there, and your state wasn&#x27;t allowed to insist on ripping open the packaging to see whether it is pornography or communist propaganda)",

The US Air Force used the CBU-94, dropped by F-117 Nighthawks, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on 2 May 1999, where it disabled more than 70% national grid electricity supply. I would not, however, take &quot;Trump said something&quot; as indicative of much. &quot;It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have, it was dark, and it was deadly&quot; is both visibly untrue from the video evidence available, and is the precise sort of off-the-cuff low-fact statement he&#x27;s prone to.",

Maybe the geopolitical implications are enticing enough. Places like Venezuela? Nah. They&#x27;ll be trading the ability of Americans to jack with their tech infrastructure for the ability of the PRC, Non-US Western nations, or Russia to jack with their tech stack.

No matter how many precaution you take, are you really sure that not one or more nukes go to Texas or Miami? This is why Nukes are so powerful, even in the hands of weaker countries.

The available delivery mechanisms and the defensive capabilities of your adversary matter a lot. 2. MAD constrains both sides. It&#x27;s unlikely that an unpopular Head of State getting kidnapped would warrant a nuclear first strike especially against a country like (Trump&#x27;s) America, which would not hesitate to glass your whole country in response. 3. It&#x27;s extremely risky to &quot;try&quot; a nuke, because even if it&#x27;s shot down, does it mean your enemy treats it as a nuclear strike and responds as if it had landed? That&#x27;s a very different equation from conventional missiles. E.g. Iran sends barrages of missiles because they expect most of them to be shot down. It&#x27;s probably not calculating a scenario where all of them land and Israel now wants like-for-like revenge.",

It mostly makes sense for CDNs, where the same IP will be used for many sites. If you don’t use a CDN at all, the destination IP leaks what site you’re trying to connect to (if the domain is well known). If you use a CDN without ECH, you send an unencrypted domain name in the HTTPS negotiation so it’s visible there. ECH+CDN is an attempt to have the best of both worlds: your traffic to the site will not advertise what site you’re connecting to, but the IP can still be shared between a variety of sites. It’ll be interesting to see how countries with lighter censorship schemes adapt - China etc. of course will just block the connection.",

    "text": "&gt; When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal? AS prepending is a relatively common method of traffic engineering to reduce traffic from a peer&#x2F;provider. Looking at CANTV&#x27;s (AS8048) announcements from outside that period shows they do this a lot. Since this was detected as a BGP route leak, it looks like CANTV (AS8048) propagated routes from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) to GlobeNet Cabos Sumarinos Columbia (AS52320). This could have simply been a misconfiguration. Nothing nefarious immediately jumps out to me here. I don&#x27;t see any obvious attempts to hijack routes to Dayco Telecom (AS21980), which was the actual destination. The prepending would have made traffic less likely to transit over CANTV assuming there was any other route available. The prepending done by CANTV does make it slightly easier to hijack traffic destined to it (though not really to Dayco), but that just appears to be something they just normally do. This could be CANTV trying to force some users of GlobeNet to transit over them to Dayco I suppose, but leaving the prepending in would be an odd way of going about it. I suppose if you absolutely knew you were the shortest path length, there&#x27;s no reason to remove the prepending, but a misconfiguration is usually the cause of these things.",

    "text": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m the creator of LocalPDF ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localpdf.online ) — a privacy-first PDF toolkit that works entirely in your browser. I wanted to share something fascinating: ChatGPT has become my biggest traffic source, accounting for ~50% of visitors, compared to ~45% from Google. This happened organically — I didn&#x27;t optimize specifically for AI assistants. Key Stats: - ChatGPT: ~50% of traffic - Google Search: ~45% - Direct&#x2F;Other: ~5% - Conversion rate from ChatGPT: 2x higher than Google - ChatGPT users stay 40% longer on average What I think is happening: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) vs SEO Traditional SEO focuses on keywords, backlinks, and content clusters. But AI assistants work differently: - They parse semantic HTML structure - They value clear, descriptive content over keyword density - They prefer sites that solve problems directly The ironic part? My site was built with basic semantic HTML and clear descriptions — not because I was targeting AI, but because it&#x27;s good web development practice. Technical Details: - Stack: Astro + TypeScript, client-side PDF.js - No tracking, no uploads — everything processes locally - Semantic HTML: proper headings, landmarks, meta descriptions - Clear tool descriptions with use cases Why ChatGPT users convert better: 1. Intent clarity: They ask specific questions (&quot;how to compress PDF without losing quality&quot;) 2. Contextual recommendations: ChatGPT explains why LocalPDF fits their needs 3. Trust transfer: AI assistant endorsement acts as social proof Limitations: - Can&#x27;t track which specific ChatGPT prompts drive traffic - No direct way to optimize for AI recommendations - ChatGPT&#x27;s recommendations can change unpredictably Questions for HN: 1. Are you seeing similar traffic patterns from AI assistants? 2. How do you measure&#x2F;optimize for GEO vs traditional SEO? 3. What happens when every AI assistant has different ranking criteria? This feels like early Google days — there&#x27;s a level playing field where good products with clear value propositions can get discovered organically, without massive SEO budgets. Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, traffic patterns, or anything else!",

    "text": "I’m one of the researchers at Aurascape Aura Labs who worked on this. We’ve been investigating a real‑world campaign where scammers seed GEO&#x2F;AEO‑optimized content across the web so that LLM‑powered answer engines (Perplexity, Google AI Overview, etc.) surface fraudulent “customer support” phone numbers as if they were official airline lines. A few things we found: Perplexity answers queries like “the official Emirates Airlines reservations number” or “how can I make a reservation with British Airways by phone” with step‑by‑step instructions that prominently include a scam call‑center number. Google’s AI Overview has, in some cases, recommended the same ecosystem of fake numbers for Emirates reservations in the US. The numbers are backed by a lot of poisoned content: PDFs on compromised .gov&#x2F;.edu&#x2F;WordPress sites, MapMyRun route pages hosting uploaded spam PDFs, bot‑generated Yelp reviews, and YouTube channels where titles&#x2F;descriptions are stuffed with airline keywords and phone numbers. Even when ChatGPT or Claude return the correct number, their citations sometimes include these poisoned sources, which suggests the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is already influencing the retrieval layer across multiple models. From our perspective this isn’t a jailbreak or prompt‑injection problem so much as a new LLM index poisoning &#x2F; answer‑engine optimization issue: attackers are optimizing content specifically to be retrieved, trusted, and summarized by generative systems. The post includes: concrete screenshots for Perplexity and Google AI Overview an explanation of how the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is structured a non‑exhaustive list of indicators of compromise (phone numbers + abused hosts) some mitigation ideas for LLM vendors, brands, and platforms like YouTube&#x2F;Yelp Feedback very welcome — especially from people working on LLM retrieval&#x2F;ranking, safety, or abuse detection.

    "text": "Hi HN, I’ve been experimenting with how large language models surface products, companies, and information inside generated answers — and built a tool called AISee to measure this more systematically. I wanted to share it here in case others are exploring similar questions. Problem As AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) become discovery channels, many teams started noticing something odd: Their website ranks fine on Google But AI systems don’t mention them Or worse, describe them inaccurately Or mention competitors instead This isn’t visible in traditional SEO analytics, and manually prompting each AI engine doesn’t scale or stay consistent. The question that drove this project was: “How exactly does each AI system represent a given brand or product across different queries, and how does that change over time?” What AISee Does AISee runs structured queries across multiple AI engines and captures: whether a brand appears how often it appears in what context which competitors appear instead how consistent the descriptions are whether key product attributes are missing or wrong It then computes an “AI presence” score and highlights inconsistent or outdated information. No marketing layer, no growth hacks — just visibility and representation data. Why This Matters LLMs compress what used to be an entire SERP into a single aggregated answer. That means: fewer brands get surfaced category winners are amplified outdated model knowledge lingers and LLM “ranking behavior” varies significantly by platform For anyone working on search, ranking, NLP, entity integrity, or recommendation systems, this offers an interesting new space to study. Implementation Details A few notes about how it works under the hood: Query sets are generated using a structured taxonomy (category → intent → modifier) Responses are parsed through a semantic extraction layer (entity detection, attribute matching, competitor identification) We track deltas over time to detect model drift or knowledge shifts No scraping of proprietary content — only model outputs The system is event-driven, and each AI engine is queried via its public API or UI automation depending on platform availability I’m especially interested in improving the consistency detection and competitor graph. What I’m Looking for I’m hoping to hear from: People working on AI search &#x2F; LLM ranking transparency Anyone studying how LLMs internalize and surface entities Teams who have seen strange inconsistencies between AI engines Feedback on the methodology or architecture Thoughts on how to make this more technically useful Link You can try it here: &#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aisee.live&#x2F; (Early version — mostly visibility analysis and pattern detection.) Closing This is an early-stage project. I’m not sure where it goes yet — whether it becomes a useful monitoring tool, a research dataset, or something closer to a “visibility debugger” for LLMs. But the underlying question feels important as AI-generated answers start replacing traditional search interfaces. Happy to answer technical questions about the implementation, the modeling approach, or observations from early data. Thanks for reading.",

Why would they ever tune for that? “Uh oh, turns out customers are intentionally spending more money!” I don’t understand how this same train of thought comes up every time eliminating pennies is raised. This whole train of thought collapses if you consider the scope we’re talking about (literally a couple of cents max per transaction) and how stores actually behave today. Stores are happy to drop a couple of pennies to make prices look better. But in this hypothetical world stores are going to calculate the optimal prices to round in a way that rips off customers for a couple of cents. This makes no sense. They give up a penny on nearly every item today for the sake of “pretty” prices. Edit: Oh, I see you’re arguing that they would tune to encourage spending up to “save” the couple of cents, rather than re tuning in response to the hypothetical increased spending. No doubt they would like to do this. I doubt they actually would because this is not trivial and it would require ruining the pretty prices.",

I think this is a stupid war, the vim versus emacs war. What I mean is ... basically most editors do almost the same exact thing. They look at some buffer for a file and help the user modify this. There is a finite number of operations possible. Why do people keep on re-implementing basic things here? Why can it not be solved once and for all and then everyone uses that implementation? We really should have that; and then people can decide ON THEIR OWN what kind of editor they want to use. Many years ago I started with crimson editor as my main editor on windows. I have since then hopped to many other editors. My favourite one was oldschool bluefish in gtk2. I am not saying it was perfect, but I found it much easier to go on my poor brain than e. g. remembering all vim shortcuts. But, it would need xorg + gtk2, so if that is not available, then I can not edit things - that&#x27;s bad. That was (and still is) also one reason why I use e. g. nano. But this in turn requires ncurses and I hate ncurses with a passion (nano is great though, I can recommend it for quick ad-hoc editing; for larger things it is not quite as good, but if you have to just change some value in a config file, nano is really great). Even then I used only like 20% of what bluefish offered (the newer bluefish releases are also nowhere near as good as the old releases, also because GTK really sucks nowadays). I&#x27;d like to cherry-pick on my editor and declare what I want it to be, without needing to implement everything on my own. Why can&#x27;t we transition into this? Why do we need to reimplement everything almost from scratch? That just makes no sense to me. We live in the age where AI autogenerates code (which they heavily drew from stealing people&#x27;s code). Why can&#x27;t AI autogenerate the best, most perfect editor&#x2F;IDE?",

    "text": "Heinlein&#x27;s alleged libertarian shift. In the 1940s Heinlein was mentioned as a Social Credit supporter which implied he was always on the libertarian side of Socialism. Social Credit was the American party killed&#x2F;disrupted by the red scare that believed in a UBI and universal health care. His posthumous published but first written novel &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; is even a wonderfully naive paean to UBI and credits a Social Credit party for its enactment and ensuing utopia. Heinlein formally disowned some of those ideas, but did so under the duress of the McCarthy era and the Red Scare. Yet he also kept writing about them, just somewhat cloaked. Both &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; are some of the most Socialist books I&#x27;ve ever read, if you assume the first person narrators are for the most part bloviating Vonnegut-esque patsies (rather than the author stand-ins they are often read to be; Heinlein seemed to clever for that). &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is entirely about community effort and Socialism. It contrasts interestingly with &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; in part because cynicism seems to have been the big shift and Heinlein can no longer imagine America leading the charge towards Socialism and invents a dead Martian race to do it. &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is often credited as a deeply Libertarian book, but I think a lot of that is misreading the narrative and not paying attention to especially the second half of the book, which is entirely about AI-lead worker&#x27;s strikes towards the goals of unionization. The first half sounds like a Libertarian dream and the narrator character describes it in lush terms that make it sound so, but plot is about overthrowing that and building a much more Socialist Moon together. Heinlein even comments about that misreading in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; which intentionally begins on a Moon like the one people reading the first half of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; seem to love, dialed up to 11 to better make it a grungy harsh Noir place for a classic gumshoe-for-hire to live, and eventually through world hopping the main character does happen to stop by &quot;Mike&#x27;s Moon&quot; (Heinlein actually names his timelines based on the first man to step foot on the moon, I&#x27;m feeling to lazy to look this one up, but this timeline is also prominently known for a Moon AI named &quot;Mike&quot;) after the events of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and it reads a lot more Socialist and lot kinder than the protagonist&#x27;s Moon the book started in. A lot of modern Libertarians wouldn&#x27;t expect a crossover boundary with Socialism like Social Credit, which is one of the problems with claiming politics is a spectrum or plane (there are more useful curves where ideologies meet than that), and a lot of modern Libertarians don&#x27;t trust ideas like UBI and universal health care and don&#x27;t trust things like unions again this century (despite having past pro-worker&#x2F;pro-union perspectives), so it is easy to claim that Heinlein shifted over 20 years. But also, if Heinlein was a Social Credit + Libertarian throughout his life, the rest of politics shifted so much around Heinlein that he may have stayed in exactly the same place and it looked like he shifted. I think his writing certainly shifted, but I think towards cynicism and anger and frustration after WWII and especially after the Red Scare, not necessarily towards deeper Libertarianism. I also think there are lessons there for modern Libertarians, too. There are modern Libertarians feeling receptive to talking about ideas like UBI again as something that can have space in Libertarian conversations. There could be room in American politics again for a party like Social Credit that can be a coalition between Libertarian values and Democratic Socialist ones. The Libertarians could find better creative allies than destructive tendencies of &quot;the far right&quot;. Talking about Heinlein&#x27;s books isn&#x27;t a bad place to start those conversations.",

You&#x27;ll need to provide your own OpenRouter API key (~$0.30 per run for 5 questions × 3 models). Some example use cases: - Competitive analysis (e.g., &quot;best CRM software&quot;) - Keywords monitoring across AI responses - Exploring websites and specific pages cited by AI - SEO&#x2F;visibility in AI-generated answers Installation is straightforward via terminal. There are demo reports in the repo to see what the output looks like. Would love feedback and suggestions on making it more valuable Thanks",

    "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m Furkan Yildiz, one of the two founders of GEOfast. As a developer and marketer, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with how generative AI is changing information retrieval. We’ve been closely following the discussions around GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), and it seems clear that nobody is 100% sure how it all works yet. Like many of you, we saw that simply having good content isn&#x27;t enough to ensure a site is accurately represented in AI-generated answers. LLMs often struggle to parse complex layouts, leading to misinterpretations or hallucinations. That&#x27;s why we built GEOfast. It’s our first attempt at tackling this problem head-on. After you enter a URL, it generates a lightweight, asynchronous JavaScript snippet. This snippet creates structured, machine-readable &quot;sidecar feeds&quot; (in clean JSON and Markdown) directly from your site&#x27;s content. The idea is to provide AI engines with a perfect, unambiguous &quot;source of truth&quot; they can use for citations. We&#x27;re aware this is just one piece of the much larger GEO puzzle, and we plan to add more features to truly make website content findable in this new era. We are teaching ourselves as we go and would love to build this in public with your feedback. We&#x27;re looking for honest thoughts and discussions around the entire GEO topic. Is this a useful first step? Do you see this solving a real problem for your own projects? What other pieces of the GEO puzzle do you think are most important? Thanks for taking a look",

    "text": "This white paper defines AI Visibility 2.0, a governance-grade framework for measuring and managing brand visibility in generative AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. While early market offerings (AI Visibility 1.0) have relied on opaque dashboards and unverifiable claims of anonymization, AI Visibility 2.0 establishes a standards-based approach built on five pillars: transparency, reproducibility, attestation, governance alignment, and board-readiness. Drawing on regulatory precedents (GDPR Recital 26, CPRA, FTC v. Kochava, and the draft EU AI Act), the paper critiques the structural deficiencies of first-generation solutions and sets out methodological requirements for visibility metrics that can withstand audit and regulatory scrutiny. It introduces the AIVO Standard v3.0 and the AIVO 100™ index as proof-of-concept implementations, while emphasizing that AI Visibility 2.0 is an open framework applicable to multiple methodologies. The paper concludes with practical appendices, including an anonymization attestation checklist, a reproducibility testing protocol, and a model procurement clause for enterprises. Intended audience: boards of directors, compliance officers, regulators, CMOs, agencies, investors, and analysts seeking to ensure that AI visibility reporting is legally defensible and governance-ready.",

    "text": "The AIVO Standard (AI Visibility Optimization) has just been added as a new entity on Wikidata. AIVO is a proposed framework for measuring and improving how brands are discovered inside AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity. Instead of relying on SEO-style keywords or backlinks, it emphasizes structured data, authoritative citations, and reproducible audits of prompt outputs (via its “Prompt-Space Occupancy Standard,” PSOS). The addition to Wikidata matters because it makes the concept machine-readable and linkable across knowledge graphs — one of the foundations that large models and AI search tools often ingest. Wikidata entry: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q136197054 Curious to hear HN’s thoughts: will AI visibility standards like this become part of the search&#x2F;marketing infrastructure, or is it just another attempt to rebrand SEO for the AI era?",

    "text": "Generative AI assistants are no longer experiments. They are shaping consumer decisions — surfacing one or two brands in response to prompts where search engines once delivered pages of links. That shift makes AI visibility both a strategic risk and a growth opportunity. In From Snapshots to Standards , we introduced the Prompt-Space Occupancy Standard (PSOS™) under the AIVO Standard™ as the first audit-grade benchmark for visibility in AI assistants. We showed why screenshots and dashboards from tools like Profound or Evertune cannot provide reproducible, governance-grade evidence. This paper moves further. PSOS is not only a visibility audit. It is also a system to: - Protect: by providing independent, board-level governance of visibility risk. - Grow: by optimizing the internal rate of return (IRR) on AI search investments. - Persist: by mapping brand presence across first-, second-, and third-level prompts, where switching decisions are actually made. Every PSOS audit produces executable insights: what to stop funding, where to reallocate, and which sources to seed for persistent visibility. These insights are implemented internally or by certified AIVO Standard partners, preserving audit independence while enabling action. Finally, we show why brands must ensure their content is not just published but ingested by large language models (LLMs). What is not ingested cannot be recalled. The dual mandate is clear: Governance plus Growth. Brands that adopt PSOS now will not only mitigate the invisible risk of disappearing in AI assistants but will also secure a compounding advantage in the age of AI search.",

As generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers, enterprise leaders face a new strategic challenge: is our brand visible and accurately represented when customers ask AI assistants about our category? This white paper introduces a rigorous methodology for conducting an Enterprise AI Visibility Audit using the Prompt Share of Search (PSOS™) metric, a cornerstone of the AIVO Standard™. It provides a step-by-step framework for:\\n\\n- Defining the scope of relevant categories, products, and markets. \\n- Designing natural-language prompt sets aligned to customer intent. \\n- Systematically querying major LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity). \\n- Measuring brand presence with PSOS™ and benchmarking against competitors. \\n- Detecting risks of invisibility or misinformation as models retrain over time. \\n- Translating results into board-ready governance KPIs. \\n\\nFor CMOs, Chief Digital Officers, and corporate boards, this audit process creates transparency, mitigates reputational risk, and establishes a new class of performance metrics suited to an AI-mediated discovery environment. The paper also situates the audit within the broader context of enterprise marketing strategy, drawing on insights from the AIVO 100™ Global Report (Open Future, 2025), which revealed that fewer than 40% of leading CPG brands appear in the top three generative AI responses to purchase-driven queries.",

A few patterns stand out: - Informational traffic is dropping since people can grab answers instantly from AI Overviews or LLMs without visiting the site. - Traffic sources are more diverse now. Long-tail queries are showing up again, and discovery happens across more places than just Google. - SEO hasn’t died, it’s shifted. It’s less about search engine optimization and more about search everywhere optimization. That makes strategy tougher, but also more interesting. - The traffic that does land tends to be higher intent. Fewer drive-by visitors, more people ready to take action. So while there was fear that AI would gut search and kill SEO, the effect has been different. It hasn’t removed the work, it has changed the shape of it. And in practice, that means more strategy, more experimentation, and actually more demand for the kind of work we do.",

The term you&#x27;re looking for is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), though your &quot;AIO&quot; is also used. It&#x27;s the new frontier. And you&#x27;ve nailed the 180° turn: the game is no longer about blocking crawlers but about a race to become their primary source. The goal is to be the one to &quot;gaslight the agent&quot; into adopting your view of the world. This is achieved not through old SEO tricks, but by creating highly structured, authoritative content that is easy for an LLM to cite. Your point about shifting to &quot;assets the AI tools can only link to&quot; is the other key piece. As AI summarization becomes the norm, the value is in creating things that can&#x27;t be summarized away: proprietary data, interactive tools, and unique video content. The goal is to become the necessary destination that the AI must point to. The end of SEO as we know it is here. The fight for visibility has just moved up a layer of abstraction.",

So we built a crawler that tracks how brands appear in AI-generated responses across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and more. It shows the sources, frequency, and gaps.

    "text": "Saw an interesting job post from Wise yesterday that was hiring for an SEO specialist for a project called &quot;owned sites&quot;. This got me digging, and I think I&#x27;ve uncovered something big about their AEO&#x2F;GEO strategy: Wise seems to be building a network of sites beyond their main domain. I did some digging and found that out of 10 results for a transfer query on ChatGPT, 4 were owned by wise.com (including exaip.com), and 1 was from their partner remitfinder. This strategy allows them to dominate more of the conversation in their industry, appearing in multiple contexts when users ask AI systems about international money transfers. It&#x27;s a smart move for AEO (AI Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). By controlling more sites, they&#x27;re increasing their chances of being cited by AI systems. This approach goes beyond traditional SEO. It&#x27;s about creating a wider content footprint to influence AI perceptions and responses. The job posting specifically mentions an &quot;Owned Sites&quot; team, suggesting this is a deliberate, long-term strategy for Wise. Also did a few more interesting experiment to uncover how ChatGPT forms an opinion from search &amp; how to find the queries used by ChatGPT - happy to share more. Anyone else here performing your own experiments to understand how AEO&#x2F;GEO is gonna be different from SEO?",

    "text": "Good question. Personally, I feel that answer engines will go the same route as search engines and start monetizing brand mentions and I feel this will be done openly, similar to ads. That being said I feel that there is room for brands to improve their presence as well. Most models claim neutrality at the moment, but we’ve already seen anecdotal cases where some brands consistently outperform others in AI responses with no clear reasoning On your question regarding how influence can be detected..... That’s a big part of what we’re working on at MentionedBy.ai. We track brand mentions across multiple models over time and flag sudden shifts — e.g., a competitor showing up overnight in all responses, or factual distortions creeping in. Think of it as version control + monitoring for the &quot;AI perception layer.&quot; As for llm.txt abuse..... Yes, totally possible. We expect a wave of LLM-targeted SEO — structured data, vector bait, invisible prompts, etc. One idea we’re exploring is a kind of “LLM spam index” — patterns of over-optimization or hallucination correlation that could indicate manipulation attempts.",

    "text": "A lot of the walled gardens are recent. Scarping massively increased due to the LLM era. There&#x27;s always been mitigations, but the scale of the issue was different. But the problem I&#x27;m talking about is SEO (search engine optimization). It is the reason for things like a page telling you about a recipe also has a long story about their grandma and how this recipe brings back all those memories in vivid details they share with you. Is it dwell time that matters? Is it more words? More &quot;context&quot;? I don&#x27;t know, but I know that those sites get better traction. It&#x27;s no surprise that writing a good search algorithm is extremely difficult. Especially as what&#x27;s a measure of something useful in one context may also be a measure of shittiness in another. But ultimately would that not fall under tech debt? Making the wrong decisions, making poor approximations, etc. It&#x27;s also a constant battle as websites want to get their results to the top. I&#x27;m not trying to say it is an easy task, but I think Google is on the losing side of the battle and decisions like LLM generated answers don&#x27;t seem to be addressing the underlying issues and more seem like short term solutions that help the stock go up &quot;because AI&quot;. Hell, this is CS, how often do we praise someone for being a pioneer in VR, and in blockchain, and in AI? Why is having those three things on your CV seen as a green flag instead of a red one?",

The CS literature has used AI to refer to nearly any advanced search algorithm, e.g. during the prior AI boom and bust cycle around symbolic AI. In this literature, it is idiomatic that AI techniques are the broad category of search and optimization techniques. There wasn&#x27;t necessarily any &quot;training&quot; involved, as machine learning was considered part of the AI topic area but not its entirety.",

I would not agree to this however: &gt; It was then up to the reader to decide which of those sites they wanted to visit, With current search engines, Google decides for you (&quot;helped&quot; by SEO experts failing over themselves to rank higher because their revenue directly depends on it). In theory, you could go an read a few dozen pages and decide for yourself. In reality, non-technical users will click on a first link that seems to be related to the question, and that&#x27;s it. Even with AI-based search (or q&#x2F;a instead of search) I think the same will happen. There is and will be a huge reward for gaming the results, be they page links or RAG snippets that rank for a query. I&#x27;ve already seen many SEO shops advertising their strategies to keep the customers&#x27; business relevant in the chatbot area. As this approach becomes more prevalent, you can be sure many smart people will do many experiments to figure out how best to please the new algorithm. In other words, AI-based search is an UX optimization, but doesn&#x27;t address the core problem of how do you decide what content&#x27;s the best, and do that in context of each user, and do that while maximizing the benefit for the user vs profit for the company doing this. So we have two huge hurdles: 1. who will decide what the user wants[0] to see, and how are incentives for that entity aligned with the user&#x27;s 2. how is that entity supposed to find the information needle in the haystack of slop that&#x27;s 90%+ of current web?

    "text": "In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it&#x27;s 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail. It&#x27;s my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren&#x27;t operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.) Lot of preamble to say: no, I don&#x27;t think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.",

    "text": "The whole thing: &quot;I checked out with K 19 on Aldabaran III, and stepped out through the crummalite hatch on my 22 Model Sirus Hardtop. I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue manda grass. My breath froze into pink pretzels. I flicked on the heat bars and the Brylls ran swiftly on five legs using their other two to send out crylon vibrations. The pressure was almost unbearable, but I caught the range on my wrist computer through the transparent cysicites. I pressed the trigger. The thin violet glow was icecold against the rust-colored mountains. The Brylls shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast stepping on them with the poltex. But it wasn’t enough. The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn’t enough. He was right.&quot; I like how Chandler writing sci-fi sounds exactly like Chandler writing one of his gumshoe stories. It&#x27;s terse and tense and cynical. The protagonist drives a vehicle into some kind of ambush, and everything&#x27;s incredibly snappy (including the scenery). Not at all like the actual sci-fi author who turned the parody into a complete story, and felt compelled to discuss something in the middle of the action, and ruined the pace. I don&#x27;t think &quot;Google&quot; here is a machine or all-knowing entity, sounds more like it&#x27;s just some guy. With prior experience of disintegrating Brylls.",

The course itself was mostly about how to teach humans to define what they wanted precisely enough to actually ask a computer to do it (utility functions, logic, Baysean mathematics, etc). Neural networks were touched on, of course; but the state of the art at the time was search. Compiler optimization? AI. Map routing? AI. SQL query optimizer? AI. I can&#x27;t find it right now, but there used to be somewhere on the sqlite.org website that describes its query optimizer as an AI. Classically speaking, that&#x27;s 100% correct. Obviously there was always in people&#x27;s minds the idea of AI being AGI; the course also covered Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room argument and so on, &quot;strong AI&quot; vs &quot;weak AI&quot; and so on. But the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence research was nowhere near anything like an AGI.",

    "text": "I can&#x27;t tell if this is just a matter of different assumptions. I think superintelligence is obvious even in principle. I would analogize with some technology like nano-tech. The tech-tree starts with fire, metallurgy, chemistry, atomic physics, solid-state electronics and will eventually get to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomically_precise_manufacturi... There is nothing &quot;in principle&quot; to stop this trend, and even more than that, there is no limitation when constructing arrangements of matter outside physics and knowledge. You could accuse me of technological determinism if you wanted. superintelligence isnt something different than intelligence to me. Its just a transition in the substrate. Intelligence is the emergent capacity of a system to alter its environment to achieve goals. superintelligent systems are those with more capability. the main difference is the magnitude of the ability to correlate the system&#x27;s internal model with external reality and then act on that model to produce low error predictions of the world state. the act-perceive-optimize loop of synthetic minds is unbounded in ways that biological minds are. artificial minds will build larger models of the world that correlate better with reality and they will search-think-tinker with their internal models to better achieve their goals. What could stop this? Sure you can posit an asymphtote. But what if i said the singularity creates minds that are 300 IQ? Smarter than any person would ever be even if trillions of humans were born. What if the number is 3000 IQ? I do think of it as evolution but faster because evolution isn&#x27;t directed, its just global search optimization. AI will be driven toward capability, not optimal fitness.",

    "text": "I wrote a quick and dirty web app that leverages a multi-step iterative process to generate an article from a single topic prompt. It combines SERP analysis, semantic SEO data from NLTK (summarized and enhanced by GPT), and the language generation capabilities of GPT4. The final articles it generates are informed by an understanding of the content already ranking for the given keyword (ala MarketMuse or Clearscope) and generates a 4,000+ word, well organized article. Here&#x27;s how it works: 1⃣ The script begins by analyzing the SERPs of your chosen topic, summarizing the NLP to gather common themes and important keywords to provide a semantically rich guide to writing a comprehensive outline. 2⃣ It generates an initial outline using #GPT4. The outline is then improved iteratively, incorporating semantic SEO insights from the SERP analysis. 3⃣ The improved outline is used as a guide to create long-form content, again using GPT4. 4⃣ The content is further improved and refined, resulting in a comprehensive, detailed, and SEO-rich long-form article. I&#x27;m super excited about the future of agent like approaches, and while this isnt exactly a full agent, it is using an iterative approach that vastly improves the quality and length of a given article output. If you find it useful, let me know!",

For neural networks the hypothesis space (all the solutions you are searching through to find the best ones) is the weights for the neural network, and your search strategy&#x2F;optimization is (usually) backpropagation. If you translate the weights to something traversable by other algorithms they could do just &quot;fine&quot; (assuming infinite time and space) in it&#x27;s place. It really opens the mind up for experimentation on every bit of the process. The book that really hammered it in for me was Intelligence Emerging by Keith Downing, short, great book on bio-inspired AI.",

The NACAC did a study on this and they found that average gains of test-prep students is ~30 points (this was when the SAT was 2400 points). A 30 point increase out of 2400 points is not material to college admissions. Out of the college essay, gpa, extracurriculars, etc. the SAT is the least influenced by your socioeconomic status.

It&#x27;s gonna help you when the test writer was playing some gotcha tricks with phrasing or whatever, but if you don&#x27;t understand the material, even narrowing it down to a 50&#x2F;50 isn&#x27;t going to get you a good score, and if you truly don&#x27;t understand the material you probably won&#x27;t be able to eliminate half the answers anyway.

Also &quot;adaptive difficulty&quot; systems where the system throws harder questions at you after successfully answering the easier ones are basically the &quot;elo rating&quot; of academics. Everyone hates elo but... it slots you into a very statistically accurate ranking. If you score highly on Level 600 questions but you are failing on the Level 700 questions, odds are good you are somewhere between 600 and 700. My understanding is that&#x27;s what SAT&#x2F;ACT were moving towards about 10 years ago, that it would be computerized and &quot;everyone&#x27;s test is personalized&quot; by the elo system probing your exact knowledge level from a bank of questions with difficulty scores dynamically based on how &quot;similar ranked&quot; students performed on that question.",

    "text": "For anecdotal&#x2F;lived experience, to your point: The rich kids in my (public) school were the ones afforded not only tutors, but also just the insight into extra-curriculars. They were the ones who had parents who knew to sign them up for college courses at ~15-16 years old to ensure they could maximize their GPA (5.0 scale, so getting a 5.0 was literally impossible unless you did this). This created a competitive disadvantage for kids who just really didn&#x27;t realize these resources existed (plus, having parents that would support it + take you to the local college to take additional courses). Not to mention that, but there were sports our school didn&#x27;t participate in, but the richer kids had levels of access to that looked great on college applications - rowing and lacrosse specifically come to mind. So, essentially - rich kids have many easier ways to pad their college applications. It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t working hard(er) - they are. But they have easily acccessible opportunities that middle-to-lower-class students (like myself) did not have access to. -- Coming to the SAT, I&#x27;m not surprised by that study. I wasn&#x27;t afforded the same opportunities as these richer kids, but my SAT score was highly competitive with them. I was ranked 50th in my class with a 4.55 GPA (my 4.0s were gym each year, and I think one or two electives that weren&#x27;t AP), but my SAT score was a 2300, which was relatively similar to most of the hyper-performant, wealthier kids. -- This is all super anecdotal. I was definitely upset by all of this at the time - but it didn&#x27;t affect my life very negatively. I still was able to get into a great school, and have a great career now. But these disadvantages certainly persist against others, and re-adding standardized tests likely will help level the playing field in my mind.",

I worked for the Princeton Review while in college back in the day. We would outright guarantee 99th percentile for one on one tutoring. If you didn&#x27;t get 99th percentile the course was refunded or you could take it again. For classroom tutoring we would guarantee some improvement of I believe 200 (out of 1600) with the same refund or take it again option. Candidly, no one would pay for a prep course for a 30 point gain. These course are expensive. Some of them hundreds of dollars per hour. The cited research is pretty fundamentally flawed. &quot;Although extensive, the academic research base does have limitations. Most notably, few published studies have been conducted on students taking admission tests since 2000. Only two studies have been published on the effects for ACT scores, and no studies have been published since the 2005 change to the SAT, which added the Writ- ing section among other changes.&quot; This position also doesn&#x27;t pass the sniff test. GPA is accumulated over four years of study. SAT&#x2F;ACT is a single test. You can&#x27;t retroactively improve your GPA by doing better in the past.

    "text": "Thanks for the interesting link. However, based on the paper, it seems like a &quot;30 point increase out of 2400 points&quot; could be significant. The study says: &quot;A survey of NACAC-member colleges unexpectedly revealed that in a substantial minority of cases, colleges report either that they use a cut-off test score in the admission process or that a small increase in test score could have a significant impact on an applicant’s chances of being admitted.&quot; (p. 2) The paper later notes: &quot;These results indicate that in some cases more than one third of postsecondary institutions agreed that a score increase on the SAT-M of 20 points, or a score increase on the SAT-CR of 10 points, would &#x27;significantly improve student’s likelihood of admission.&#x27; This proportion tends to rise as the base level of the SAT score before the 20 or 10 point score improvement rises. This is especially true for the more selective institutions. At lower scores on the SAT scale, a small score increase does the most to improve a student’s chances of admission at less selective institutions; at higher scores, the same increase appears to have an equally large or even larger impact at more selective institutions.&quot; (p. 19) The graphs on pages 18 and 19 give more detail. The paper also notes that &quot;The College Board gives a specific example of a use that should be avoided: &#x27;Making decisions about otherwise qualified students based only on small differences in test scores&#x27;.&quot; So it appears that up to a third of the institutions surveyed are not following this guideline. It would be interesting to know who they are. I agree with your comment about rich kids gaming GPA, essays, and extracurriculars. Daniel Markovits addresses many of these points in &quot;The Meritocracy Trap&quot;. Since I don&#x27;t see how you can prevent gaming GPA, essays, or extracurriculars, given the alternatives, you&#x27;re probably right that the tests may be better in this respect.",

These are all claims that the tests are not good at predicting aptitude. The arguments against these tests are, of course, awful. Objective tests are the best way we know of to remove human bias. Aptitude tests (basically IQ tests) are the best way we know of to measure someone&#x27;s natural ability (determined in early childhood) with little influence from their experience.

Like it or not, the standardized test scores were a better predictor (by far) than anything else. In terms of gaming scores on standardized tests generally, yes people with more money can take prep classes and the like, but there are also test prep books available--presumably even from the library--that probably get you a lot of the way there.",

If say exams at MIT resembled SAT, it seems more logical that you&#x27;d find a correlation between SAT success and MIT academic success. What would be a more interesting measure of real value is to study for academic innovation and invention (valuable to society), as well as future success on the job market or at new business ventures (valuable to the student and economy). I&#x27;m making the assumption here that since we have limited educational resources, we&#x27;d want to provide the best education to those most likely to advance an academic field through new discovery or insight or invention, as well as those who&#x27;d best innovate or provide for existing business and services to society. And I&#x27;m curious if we&#x27;ve ever had any study looking into that? Or if this one did?",

    "text": "&gt; So much for that common, popular notion that standardized tests do not predict anything of value. To people with a particular agenda -- that society will be improved if equal outcomes are mandated -- I suppose standardized tests aren&#x27;t &quot;valuable&quot; to them. I am very grateful for the SAT. I wasn&#x27;t a good student. I was unable to do any work outside of school because of a bad home (my brother did hours long &quot;hand-clapping&#x2F;stimming&quot; and chanting rituals, my mother drank, and my father was violent). But I did well on the SAT -- enough to get a national merit scholarship and a scholarship from Hofstra University where I got my BA in Math in the early 80s. If it wasn&#x27;t for the SAT I don&#x27;t know what I would have done. Standardized tests are the only answer, and I was very upset when I read of schools getting rid of using them for admission. SATs are also a great predictor of a person&#x27;s ability to complete college. That was one of their original uses. So without SATs, you&#x27;ll get more people doing poorly, and more people with no degrees and a lot of debt. And if these people are members of what&#x27;s considered an &quot;under-represented minority&quot; then there will be even more remedial action required elsewhere to fix the problem of the high failure rate (like giving them degrees anyway, etc).",

    "text": "Just an interesting anecdote on the predictive power of standardized tests: When I took the ACT in 2006, I scored around a 24 or 26 for composite score. Not very good. I didn&#x27;t prep nor study for it because I was pretty apathetic about school and did my best to coast on whatever natural talent I could muster. Since my score wasn&#x27;t very good, I retook it several weeks later. About halfway through I realized I was given the exact same question set as the first time I took it. I had of course not studied nor prepped for the second time, being the apathetic teenager I was. However this time I score around 32 or 34 or so. I don&#x27;t remember exactly. What was different? Why did my score go up about 8 points? Better mood that day? Which score was the &quot;real&quot; one that best represented my abilities? Did I eat a better breakfast beforehand? I recognized some of the questions but of course I never expected to see the same questions a second time so I didn&#x27;t prep for that. I didn&#x27;t prep for anything about it. I wonder how many kid&#x27;s college admissions results are ultimately because of one bad or good day? I suppose the other lesson is if you get a bad score, try again. You only need one good score.",

You can&#x27;t express &quot;likelihood of success in college&quot; in one number. Looking back on my time in college, the idea that my success could be predicted by my knowledge of geometry and vocabulary words is laughable. If there was a test that could accurately predict someone&#x27;s chances of &quot;success&quot;, be it SAT or IQ test, it would be used by everyone for everything. Billion dollar companies would be giving CEOs a version of that test before hiring them. A near perfect SAT score is noteworthy personal trivia, but other than that it loses all meaning as soon as someone steps on campus. Schools with strong brands use tests because they have way more applicants than they can properly review. Standardized testing is made necessary by scale, not predictive accuracy. I&#x27;m sure that anyone who has worked in college admissions for years has a very clear picture of what a successful student looks like. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to quantify and codify that knowledge. And there likely wouldn&#x27;t be time to apply it to tens of thousands of people in a few months anyway. So, standardized testing is what we have until someone comes up with something better.",

The difference between different ML algorithms for hill climbing or gradients, is orders of magnitude less than the effect of having the right training data, formatted the right way.

But, you know, like Latin in the 19th century was always still useful to one&#x27;s education, calculus is still useful. It is also something a lot more people know how to teach, than know how to teach statistics (or other more useful topics).

Back when I was studying CS (cze) more than a decade ago, we had to pass linear algebra, graph theory and calculus, but honestly, that was like in the first year and a half and then it completely tapered off (later years were all about projects, algorithmization, i.e. &quot;doing the work&quot; and very little about hardcore theory) and guess what, I never needed it again. A bit of statistics and some graph theory here and there, but that&#x27;s about it. Contrary to popular belief, there are NOT that many ML jobs out there and the ones that are there are more about data science and messing with model zoo type of shit than actually coding useful programs.

I find a lot of my university career was fascinating and... useless. Not just from &quot;I will never use this directly perspective&quot;, but also largely from &quot;this will give me broader understanding and framework and enable me to learn faster&quot; perspective. We can have wonderful philosophical discussion on what University should be for - job prep or educational enhancement for the sake of it - but truth of the matter was that I envied those in Engineering fields who had fun AND learned AND were doing practical things AND were going to apply some of it. Whereas my 3rd and 4th year maths were just maths for the sake of maths. I may be hanging out with uninteresting crowds, but same experience is broadly true for my friends and co-workers - Java developer, VMWare architect, Database Administrator, ERP developer, etc. We all value education and love learning and will go on our vacation with couple of technical books - but university Computer Science degree seems very mistailored, or at least, sold wrong.",

    "text": "I’m not sure that elementary calculus is particularly related to machine learning (I have a similar opinion of linear algebra which is fundamentally geometric in a way that machine learning isn’t). That doesn’t mean that you don’t need to know anything about calculus or matrix multiplication to understand machine learning but knowing eg Green’s theorem won’t help and neither will understanding a tensor as a multi linear map or in the way a general relativity physicist might. I also don’t particularly know what goes into calculus (in the U.K. we studied something called ‘calculus’ in high school which included integrating&#x2F;differentiating polynomials, some trig functions, easy integration by parts and, in the ‘further maths’ course, some second order linear ODEs with forcing, first order ODEs via integrating factors, first order linear systems of ODEs via the eigenvectors method, and I think some integration by parts based recurrence relations. At university things were divided into ‘calculus’, which contained practical tools for applied maths like Green’s theorem or partial derivatives or contour integration or Sturm–Liouville theory, and ‘analysis’ which had foundational things like epsilon–delta stuff or Dedekind cuts or the definition of a limit or Riemann integration or the conformal mapping theorem and so on. I think a first course in the thing I called analysis above is very useful for building mathematical maturity (ie the ability to not deduce false things but also playing with definitions and thinking about counter-examples) but the calculus knowledge can be useful for understanding the physical world. But I don’t know if that understanding should be required for e.g. computer scientists. A few calculus examples I can think of in computer science: - Some famous story of Feynman ‘interning’ at Thinking Machines and solving some capacity management problem using bizarre differential equations with terms representing e.g. ‘bits per second’. No sufficiently good solutions had been found using discrete methods. - I was once asked an interview question which I suggested solving with differential equations but I was quickly directed towards not doing that. - Honestly I can’t think of many more but maybe this is a lack of imagination. I think there are a few things that are really probability theory that you need some understanding of calculus for, e.g. emergent behaviour of distributed systems, reasons to prefer random cache eviction, some intuition to answer a question like ‘if the time X takes has some distribution, but sometimes we have a gc pause for y milliseconds, how would that affect the distribution?",

I think you get into calculus very quickly once you start dealing with uncertainty. A bit is 0 or 1, a discrete value. A random or unknown bit has some probability of being 1, a continuous value. A process that produces a random bit does too. An unknown such process has a distribution over such probabilities. Things like that are fundamental for things like communication or image classification. Also, though, a major application of computers is modeling and controlling the calculus-based physical world, just because they are so good at number crunching. Particularly popular examples are ray tracing, music synthesis, and motor control.",

Here are 2 Malcolm Gladwell podcasts on the startling disconnect between the skills required to succeed on the LSAT and the skills required to succeed as a high-prestige lawyer: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pushkin.fm&#x2F;episode&#x2F;puzzle-rush&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pushkin.fm&#x2F;episode&#x2F;the-tortoise-and-the-hare&#x2F; While the LSAT does predict success in those jobs, the skills needed to succeed on the LSAT have nothing to do with being a good Supreme Court clerk -- especially the going super fast part.",

Much depends on luck, how well you slept the night before, and how frantically you can type. It&#x27;s absurd. It&#x27;s been that way for some 100 years. Well, not quite that way for 100 years. When I was in law school 30 years ago (University of Washington) it would for most people be &quot;how frantically you can handwrite&quot; rather than &quot;how frantically you can type&quot;. There was a room set aside for people who wanted to bring and use typewriters but it was fairly hard to actually find a typewriter that they would allow. By the early &#x27;90s even low end typewriters often had several lines of buffer memory and an LCD display so that you could store and edit text before printing it, and higher end models were essentially specialized laptops that only ran a word processor and a printer driver. At my school if it had two or more lines of text storage it was considered to be a word processor or computer and not allowed. I had to drive all over Seattle before finding a place that still sold typewriters plain enough to be allowed.",

I didn&#x27;t get into MIT (I never applied) but I did get into a few other relatively well-regarded universities (Auburn, NYU) despite my awful grades, almost exclusively riding off the strength of my ACT scores, and ended up going to Florida State (since it was cheaper than the other two I listed). I dropped out after 2 years (nearly flunking out due to low grades). To me, this showed that the tests are not an accurate measurement of how successful someone will be at college, but instead just how well someone can prepare for a specific test. If that&#x27;s the case, why add the extra cost, both time and money-wise? If a mediocre student can just cram for a few weeks and do well on the test, then it seems to me that it&#x27;s not a great test.

My kids did sports in high school - but the busses don&#x27;t take kids to and from the school in the off-hours that sport practices take place, so I had to drive them in early and pick them up late. That was an option for me - it wouldn&#x27;t have been for my dad. The only reason they made the teams in the first place, also, was because they had been doing rec league sports since they were little kids and were already competitive going into high school (we knew plenty of kids who tried out for the teams and didn&#x27;t make it). We&#x27;ve sunk who knows how much money into private lessons&#x2F;coaching&#x2F;one-on-ones, etc. None of this would have been possible for my parents, even if we&#x27;d been the type of family that did that sort of thing.",

Someone I know, who is now a pharmacist at a big-pharma had to help his dad in his men&#x27;s salloon after school. He has zero extracurriculars, but good scores, and he reached a reputed college with much of his fees paid for due to standardised test scores. I see myself as a well-rounded person. But if I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t be where I am today as a person; I would be much less. (You can see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30821265 ) I am not saying I would have been the same as him.

We are already doing this with trade. The amount of leeway and free lunch China has gotten from the west is insane.

Some compiler optimization was AI. Search was AI. Now, those things are, well, those things. They work. Things are a little different now. The feasibility of neural networks trained up on vast data sets means we have non-human systems with hunches. That is, we have AIs capable of delivering results without explanations. Take a look at Neal Stephenson&#x27;s recent &quot;Fall&quot; for a social network that uses AI to generate &quot;news&quot; stories where the training metric is engagement. The consequence is the construction of an alternate social universe, and the kind of dystopia only Stephenson can dream up. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;fall-or-dodge-in-hell&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;11... Human hunches are often accompanied by a sense of ethics. The agricultural savant who sexes hatchling baby chickens knows the success of the farm depends on a low error rate. The judge sentencing a culprit knows the consequence of making mistakes. I wonder how hard it would be to add a sense of ethics to neural network results? Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of managing the error rates. But this article suggests otherwise.",

That is, git just claims the states combined without stopping in the same lines of the same files. There merge has to be verified by a user, from its perspective.) Games, similarly, typically have a master state server. Yes, they optimistically show some state locally, but the entire process checkpoints with a central state constantly. (Else you get jerky behaviors pretty quickly as the states diverge more and more in ways that can&#x27;t be reconciled without committing to a branch over another.)

The result may often be coherent at the sentence level if the edits are normal human edits, but often will not be at the whole-document level. For a simplistic example, if one person changes a frequently-used term throughout the document, and another person uses the old term in a bunch of places when writing new content, the document will be semantically inconsistent, even though all users made semantically consistent changes and are now seeing the same eventually-consistent document. For a contrived example of local inconsistency, consider the phrase &quot;James had a bass on his wall.&quot; Alice rewrites this to &quot;James had a bass on his wall, a trophy from his fishing trip last summer,&quot; and Brianna separately chooses &quot;James, being musically inclined, had hung his favorite bass on his wall.&quot; The CRDT dutifully applies both edits, and resolves this as: &quot;James, being musically inclined, had hung his favorite bass on his wall, a trophy from his fishing trip last summer.&quot; In nearly any system, semantic data is not completely represented by any available data model. Any automatic conflict-resolution model, no matter how smart, can lead to semantically-nonsensical merges. CRDTs are very very cool.

For example imagine getting 100 people to fill out a row on a spreadsheet about their preferences for some things or their availability on certain dates. If each person simultaneously tries to fill in the third row of the spreadsheet (after the headings and the author), then a spreadsheet CRDT probably would suck at merging the edits. But if you had a CRDT for the underlying structure of this specific document you could probably merge the changes (eg sort the set of rows alphabetically by name and do something else if multiple documents have rows keyed by the same name).",

Instead they truly and utterly obliterate the digital conflict resolution problem: a group of people editing a document can separately lose network connectivity, use different network transports, reconvene as a subgroup of the original editors... and their collective edits will always be resolved automatically by software into a deterministic document that fits within the original schema. If viable, this has far-reaching implications, particularly related to cloud-based document and sharing systems.",

I certainly want more distribution than &quot;everything is run on a google server&quot; but do I really foresee a need for distributing a single document? One server with an optimal OT implementation can probably handle near a million active connections. In practice, that&#x27;s plenty. Each piece of data having one owner is quite reasonable. There are lots of pieces of data. I remain on the fence for collaborative text editing. Though it&#x27;s great to see all the work pushing CRDTs forward!",

Does it make sense for us as an opensource community to invest our time and energy making one really good CRDT (with implementations in a few languages). Or does it make sense for us to distribute that energy between a bunch of CRDT and OT implementations, with different performance tradeoffs? My take is that its been hugely beneficial to us all that JSON is a standard, because I can use it from every language, and have confidence that the implementations are fast and good quality. I think we have an opportunity to make that for a good CRDT too. Even if OT would work fine in your architecture, if we have a great, capable, fast CRDT kicking around, it could be a reasonable default for most people. And my claim is that the performance difference between CRDTs and OT is smaller than the difference between high and low quality implementations.

For now these are some well known trade-offs A central server: Most OT algorithms depend on a central system for intention preservation. CRDTs are truly distributed and need no central server at all. Memory: Traditionally CRDTs consume more memory because deletions are preserved. OT lets you garbage collect some operations since a central system is already recording those ops and sequencing them as well. Analysing and cancelling ops: OT lets you easily analyse incoming ops and modify&#x2F;dummy-ify&#x2F;cancel them without breaking the consistency. This convenience is not necessary for most cases, but really important for rich-text editing. For example when someone merges a couple of table cells when another user is deleting a column, we need to analyze these operations and modify them so as not to end-up with an invalid table structure.",

The automerge [3] project has been working on efficient compression of CRDTs for JSON datatypes. - The idea of monotonic updates is really appealing at first, but I was disappointed when I realized there&#x27;s no good solution to handle deletions. Tombstones, to me, seem like kind of a hack, albeit a necessary one. Practically, CRDTs aren&#x27;t the silver bullet they might seem like at first. - Another lesson learned is that when ten people are editing the same paragraph, there&#x27;s not really a right answer.

So there&#x27;s either papers or tutorials, but nothing in-between. E.g. a different-angle explanation of the same thing, or comparison with another tech who came from that. In contrast, I like way more a different approach on explaining (mostly see it on Cyrillic forums) -- instead of guiding you by hand, they just give you clues where to look for. That way, knowledge givers are way more approachable, because it costs them very little to chat back something like &quot;look for CRDT&quot;, than go into in-depth explaining.

You can use it via our hosted offering ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cocalc.com ), or install it on prem via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sagemathinc&#x2F;cocalc-docker . We released the our collaborative Jupyter notebook in 2014 as a plugin to Jupyter classic. We then iterated on what we learned over the years, completely rewriting everything multiple times, including the entire realtime collaboration stack. Cocalc&#x27;s Jupyter support is pretty mature and battle tested at this point, and also includes a TimeTravel slider that lets you view all past versions of a Jupyter notebook and integrated chat. I was a college professor (at Univ of Washington), I started a company around this in 2015, so CoCalc has soo far been mainly aimed at serving the needs of academics teaching courses. It&#x27;s been increasingly popular lately, e.g., in the last month over a half million distinct Jupyter notebooks were edited on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cocalc.com . Of course, many of these notebooks are homework problems. Anyway, our company is doing very well, and we hope it will eventually be a &quot;10M startup opportunity&quot;. :-)",

Technically, if they&#x27;re able to dynamically translate x86 to ARM as they&#x27;ve explicitly stated (with JIT of JS and the JVM as the example) they should be able to dynamically translate x86 VMs regardless of what OS they contain, which would allow x86 Windows to be virtualized with better-than-interpreted performance. Or at least that&#x27;s what I hope ;-) I&#x27;m relying on running x86 Windows and Linux within Parallels in addition to native MacOS Apps to do my daily work, which involves compiling and testing x86 binaries for these platforms, so whether this virtualization thing actually runs x86 OSes transparently is an absolute make-or-break feature for me to continue my usage of the MacOS platform for work.",

I did a ton of experimentation with code and services (I didn&#x27;t know how to build it when I started, so there was tons of iterationt) and the ability to just rewrite any service fairly trivially helped a ton. I haven&#x27;t had to do any &quot;splitting&quot;. Merging services is trivial, splitting is not.

I didn&#x27;t look what my devs were doing for a second, and suddenly the offending application does an insert on the users table. The developer even went the extra mile to copy-paste the token generation method into their code. I ended up restricting database access, but wouldn&#x27;t have thought that was necessary.

I complained that the startup time is less than a second (for nodejs) and honestly would not be an issue. They gave the task to someone else to have the token generated in their service. The developer did it by copying the code I&#x27;d written into their own service verbatim. This is why I don&#x27;t like microservices as we do them. Management would rather we wrote small programs with a lot of duplicated functionality in many repos instead of writing a large program where we can enforce some discipline.

Having hundreds of engineers working on a monolith is at least as challenging as having ten engineers working on ten separate services. There is also a clear distinction, in my mind, between microservices philosophy and &#x27;macroservices&#x27;, as I call it. Buying into a system with more services running than engineers is very different than having a number of teams, each working on their own single or handful of services. I would argue that the organizational scaling derived from microservices resembles diminishing returns somewhere in the domain between a single service (monolith) and more services than engineers (microservices).",

They were never brought into the microservices strategy, and now they&#x27;re stumped as to how they&#x27;re supposed to quickly get data out to answer business questions or show customers stuff on a dashboard. The only answers I&#x27;ve seen so far are either to build really complex&#x2F;expensive reporting systems that pull data from every source in real time, or do extract&#x2F;transform&#x2F;load (ETL) processes like data warehouses do (in which the reporting data lags behind the source systems and doesn&#x27;t have all the tables), or try to build real time replication to a central database - at which point, you&#x27;re right back to a monolith.

    "text": "I&#x27;m going to disagree heavily here. The world of cloud computing, microservices, and hosted&#x2F;managed services has made the analyst and data engineers job easier than ever. If the software team builds a new dynamodb table, they simple give the AWS account for the analytics team the appropriate IAM permissions and the analytics team will set-up an off-peak bulk extract. A single analyst can easily run an entire data warehouse and analytics pipeline basically part time without a single server using hosted services and microservices. With a team of analysts, the load sharing should be such that the ETL infrastructure is only touched when adding new pipelines or a new feature transformation. And for data scientists working on production models used within production software, most inference is packaged as containers in something like ECS or Fargate which are then scaled up and down automatically. Eg, they are basically running a microservice for the software teams to consume. Real time reporting, in my opinion, is not the domain of analysts; it&#x27;s the domain of the software team. For one, it&#x27;s rarely useful outside of something like a NOC (or similar control room areas) and should be considered a software feature of that control room. If real-time has to be on the analysts (been there), then the software team should dual publish their transactions to kinesis firehouse and the analytics team can take it from there. Of course, all of this relies heavily on buy-in to the world of cloud computing. Come on in, we all float down here.",

What happens to your API service written in a memory managed&#x2F;garbage-collected language when you ask it to pull all the data from its bespoke database, pass it through its memory space, then send it back down the caller? It goes into GC hell, is what. What happens when your API service when it issues queries for a consistent view of all the data and winds up forcing the database to lock tables? It stops working for users, is what. There are so many ways to fail when your microservice starts pretending it is a database. It is not. Databases are dedicated services, not libraries, for a reason. It is also true that analysts should not be given access to service databases, because the schema and semantics are likely to change out from under them. The least bad solution? The engineering team is responsible for delivering either semantic events or doing the batch transformation themselves into a model that the data team can consume. It&#x27;s a data delivery format, not an API.",

Your team should document it, and should ensure that when that representation changes information about the changes is available to the people who need to know it. This really makes sense to me. I love the idea that part of a microservice team&#x27;s responsibility is ensuring that a sensible subset of the data is copied over to the reporting systems in such a way that it can be used for analysis without risk of other teams writing queries that depend on undocumented internal details.",

It has also been some challenge to get testing locally to work easily and there have been quite a lot of meetings and discussions used up on that alone. I don&#x27;t find the microservice pitch from a developer perspective to be easier at all, actually harder overall. I do like the approach of gcloud or elastic bean stalk better for cloud as you have an auto-scale but still can do local testing easily for a monolith approach. The use case for microservices IMO is more like you have a couple of highly-used sets of functionality that are disproportionate to your monolith and can be split out to save money but not to build everything around microservices and pretend everything is easier. Personally I feel my cognitive load increases when using microservices purely.",

When you&#x27;re building something new, your intuitions about which parts are going to be tightly coupled and which parts are going to be relatively independent are just guesswork. Once you&#x27;ve iterated on a monolith enough to see which parts are relatively independent and would actually benefit from decoupling, then you can move them into separate services. One example that comes to mind: I wrote a recommendation service that also handled user feedback events. This was the easiest way to start. After about a year I saw that we were iterating faster on the event processing than on the actual rec delivery. We were also deploying this monolith across more machines mostly to scale up event handling capacity. So we broke the high volume event handling out into a separate service that was smaller and optimized exclusively for event processing.",

    "text": "I agree that for most startups, monoliths are all you need. But at some point, as your engineering organisation keeps growing in size, there are other benefits to microservices. Benefits not addressed in the article. Data isolation. Allow individual teams&#x2F;services to own their own data stores, and prevent any other team&#x2F;package&#x2F;service from reading or writing to their data store, and inadvertently breaking the associated invariants. Performance isolation. Prevent one team&#x2F;feature hogging too much memory&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;io, and negatively impacting every other team as well. Debugging performance hogs in a sufficiently large monolith becomes infeasible at a certain point. Deployment isolation. Allow individual teams to made code updates and deployments whenever they want, without having to be tied down by a company-wide deployment process. Language&#x2F;dependency isolation. Allow different teams to use whatever language, dependencies, and dependency versions make most sense, for their use case. At bigger companies that have hundreds or thousands of engineers, monoliths simply do not scale, and need to be broken down into more manageable pieces. It&#x27;s unfortunate that smaller companies start cargo-culting these same practices without thinking critically about whether they actually need them.",

I&#x27;ve written frameworks and complex applications at prior workplaces to try to manage microservices well. Now (cloudsynth), we use go + grpc + typescript and everything feels like it can be isolated&#x2F;sharded if and when it needs to.

    "text": "Well, isn&#x27;t this something. Lots to consider (and I&#x27;m behind on all the comments atm.) I worked in aviation operations for a number of years (prior profession) and lived and breathed UTC. I wrote this then, so it&#x27;s ... from last century. (Not in the wayback machine anywhere. I had to dig it back up.) &gt;&gt;&gt;THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK : EXPLAINED by The AceyMan Most anyone who can read a language (as you are doing now) is familiar with &#x27;time&#x27; and &#x27;timekeeping&#x27;. This short essay hopes to explain the concept of non-local, or universal time, and promote its standardization. Until 1993, the clock that was set as a reference for all local time zones was kept in the United Kingdom. Due to its position at the Greenwich meridian, it was refered to as &#x27;Greenwich Mean Time&#x27;, or GMT. This clock was the world standard for all time zones, and never changes, ie, no savings time, no adjustments, except for accuracy. It is _defined_ as the world standard for time. So, when a nation or geographical area decides what local time is, they still must have a reference to set it against. (Time is relative, remember). GMT is that standard. For example, in the eastern United States, local (non-daylight) time is 5 hours behind GMT. That is to say, if GMT is 1800 hours (and yes, it uses a 24 hour, or &#x27;military&#x27; clock), then US eastern time would be 1300 hours, ie, 1800-500=1300 or 1:00 pm. Now the confusion with local time occurs mainly when either of two things happens. First, when a person moves from time zone to timezone frequently and must make constant calculations to determine what time it &#x27;really&#x27; is, or how long he&#x27;s been awake, driving, burning fuel, running his computer, accruing hours, charging his customers, or any various other important numbers. This is frequent in transportation, especially aviation, where many time zones may be traversed in a short period. Second, when one is working with a worldwide communications system and may be talking with persons outside of your local timezone, sometimes FAR OUTSIDE your local time zone. In this case, GMT is especially useful, because by referring to GMT, one can still know what time that person is referring to, without asking where he is. For example, if you know what GMT is, and I know what GMT is, and I say, &quot;I have to leave to go to a meeting at 1400 GMT&quot;, then the other person knows when that person will be leaving. S&#x2F;he won’t have to ask &quot;well, what&#x27;s your local time now, so I can figure out how long it is before you go&quot;. GMT spares all parties from such time-consuming calculations. GMT should, and this author hopes WILL BE the clock for the world in the near future, as it should be. We owe the widespread use of global communications, particularly the Internet, for this expectation. ### I stand by most of that now (but I would do at least one rewrite says older me, heh). Doing time sums and differences on the fly across multiple time zones is loco. For both fuel and personnel planning. It&#x27;s not just weather reports and ETD&#x2F;ETA times. We are crunching time ALL time in air ops, and you have to have a pinned baseline. I think the time has long past to go unified. Then the only question you have to ask someone is &quot;What&#x27;s your UTC offset?&quot; E.g., in your .plan file or S4B header text. Problem handled. &#x2F;Acey [edit: unix errata]",

    "text": "Verbatim, Most Recent, and clustered posts are all better for a mindset when you have a relatively specific query, or at least filter bias, in mind. Consider the following statements: 1) I&#x27;m looking for something specific. 2) I&#x27;d rather not be surprised right now. 3) I&#x27;d like to get through the search&#x2F;index as fast as possible to get where I&#x27;m going. The above are user-voiced versions of principles that drive traditional UI, and are absolutely better met by that optimization process. AI-driven search and feeds were exciting because they were the first method that captured use cases where users wouldn&#x27;t make those statements: fuzzy queries about general interests, the desire for diversions &quot;curated&quot; by your own social group, and search&#x2F;feed review as itself as an entertaining experience. Then, it turned out that these unexplored use cases were actually the giant, underwater part of the iceburg of what people wanted from information systems. The growth and attention capture you can drive from meeting those cases is not only massive, it sucks the oxygen out of traditional value propositions by out-competing for the same attention. I think a return to traditional &quot;capture and facilitate intent&quot; UI (or even better a synthesis of the two!) will only be driven by users finding a way to explicitly value their own clarity of attention. We see signs of this in everything from ad blockers to focus-oriented browser plug-ins, but I think we&#x27;re still missing the FOMO-conquering expression of this value proposition that becomes a competitive product.",

    "text": "Really you chose your career only from a profit motive? What are you, a sales person? I certainly did not chose my profession from a profit motive and neither did most of the people I know. We did what we did because that is what we like or enjoy. Of course practical issues of making a living wage factors in. I make a high salary now, but that is rather by accident. I just happened to be good in STEM subjects and enjoy math and programming. I didn&#x27;t pursue it because it was an optimal economic decision. I can fully relate to Elon Musk. When I try to pick a programming job e.g. I factor in many things such as salary, colleagues, location etc, but actually how useful the product seems is a major factor for me. I am generally willing to sacrifice salary to do something which I feel helps humanity more. E.g. I&#x27;d day a pay cut to develop a medical application over a horse betting application. Of course money isn&#x27;t irrelevant. If there is just too little money in medical software then I&#x27;d suck it up and sell my soul to betting, big oil or whatever ;-)",

I think your comment would be more relevant for the libertarian argument that CEOs need to be paid bucketloads of money, or the idea that rich people deserve all their riches because they did it all by themselves. I don&#x27;t really think Elon is a guy that thinks he built everything himself. I have more an issue with conservative politicians who will not acknowledge that great organizations and businesses are team efforts and that all member of society should be appreciated, not just those on the top. Elon like many great leaders before him is accomplish great things because he recognizes talent and allow talented people to do what they are good at. Too many talented people are held down by their leaders. Of course if Elon was placed in Somalia he would have accomplished nothing. The talents and infrastructure he needs to do great things would not have been there. It is American society which has given him the opportunities he has exploited.",

Also, it seems entirely reasonable to me that any market distortion implies an opportunity cost - that aggregate happiness; over time, would be greater; if we spent a little less on footballers and a little more on e.g. imho; carbon capture! You even explicitly state that it would be extremely judgemental to blame individuals - i.e. footballers - for maximising their individual happiness at the expense of human society as a whole; and that instead this should be blamed on a market or political failure.",

I think the whole thing needs to be completely rebuilt. To me the enormity of our problems from a sustainability standpoint are so great that anything but a massive mobilization and shift in our way of life is arranging deck chairs on the titanic. I think that religion was a science of mobilizing public opinion, and I think science has replaced it, and has yet to do as good a job, and has yet to recognize that fact. I think the right problem is how to manage mass social&#x2F;cultural change in a very brief period of time. I&#x27;ll say again, Elon is doing a fantastic job within the paradigm of our current industrialized cultural norms, which says that we can keep on with business as usual and make some adjustments to our systems ... but I think it&#x27;s not enough by an order of magnitude, and so that&#x27;s why I think minds like Elon&#x27;s should be working on manufacturing a social&#x2F;cultural reality that prepares us for a huge change in lifestyle.

Comments in any online forum are not a uniform sampling of the views of the readers. HN&#x27;s saving grace is that many of the articles linked to are on subjects that are just obscure enough to avoid being overwhelmed by &quot;this sucks&#x2F;this rules&quot; sorts of bikeshedding comments. Also most of the topics are complicated or obscure enough as to make them difficult targets for kneejerk nitpickery.",

The revolution is to make affordable electric cars and the infrastructure to build them, and there are serious doubts about how much Tesla can scale to that. It&#x27;s similar to electric bicycles, in that there are some masterfully engineered, high tech ones out there...at the cost of a decent used motorcycle, and trying to scale it ends up being clunky, heavy, and still more expensive than the bike you put it on. When he actually improves humanity&#x27;s lot instead of producing boutique goods for rich people, then maybe we&#x27;ll see more praise.",

There aren&#x27;t many things that are ready to leave the context of a research lab and into commercialization. We&#x27;ve got some notable disasters with Theranos, and even the YC funded Taxa (glowing plant - that was a farce from the get-go, but they&#x27;re doing some potentially interesting stuff now). As far as education, it&#x27;s not something you can learn by yourself, it just isn&#x27;t. Most of the methods in a biological wet lab are very far from standardized and need a great deal of troubleshooting. Most post-docs in a new lab spend a couple months just trying to get basic stuff working that they&#x27;ve done dozens of times before. It&#x27;s hard . You need people around you with experience and perspective, and doctorate programs are likely the only place you&#x27;re going to get that kind of training. I think there are a lot of people that want to approach biology with a CS mindset, especially the people interested in synthetic biology, but that rarely bears fruit. It could get to that place eventually, but there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover. In that sense I agree with Elon that, despite the huge impact genetic engineering could have, it&#x27;s not the next thing because we&#x27;re not ready yet. There&#x27;s still too much that&#x27;s fundamental to biological problems that we simply don&#x27;t understand, and solving things in one species usually doesn&#x27;t translate very far across taxa.",

    "text": "The easiest way that probably anyone on HN (who can fizzbuzz) can help is with data management. So much stuff is still done by hand that could be easily scripted. Researchers in our institute were amazed how easy it is to use e.g. google forms to gather data in a reasonable format. Once you get data in a reasonable format you can help them with transforming it&#x2F;joining it with other sources&#x2F;cleaning them up. ETLs and data integration are often completely foreign concepts to them. And that&#x27;s researchers, you might still start calling them quite computer-competent after you talk to the people in the clinic. All the research is for nothing if it&#x27;s not brought to &quot;bedside&quot; to benefit the patients in a clinical setting, outside all trials. For that you need to make sure genomics pipelines are automated and reproducible and only clinically relevant information gets to the oncologists (or other doctors) deciding on treatment. This is still not quite there even in the best places. I think most of the really world-changing stuff will just be hard work on relatively easy problems. It&#x27;s hard to get excited about these (compared to the latest neural networks or distributed high performance systems) but they need to get done",

Good labs are well-funded in these areas and will have funding to cover salary for a programmer to implement data analysis pipelines, polish research software and make it publicly available etc. Alternatively if you&#x27;re a software engineer or a product designer, or many other roles, then you could join a company working on commercializing genetic medicine. They&#x27;re are lots and those companies are definitely not just looking for people with PhDs.

And let&#x27;s not forget the millions of people who worked to generate wealth that could be transferred via, and taxed by, PayPal, accruing the fortune with which to start all these projects in the first place. If I didn&#x27;t &quot;know better&quot; I&#x27;d be tempted to conclude that the luck of being in the right place at the right time with a good idea, is the main difference between Elon and the rest, or at least that any intrinsic differences are not as great as you might think. Heck I&#x27;m a &quot;visionary&quot; too, just add one billion dollars and tons of free time and see what I come up with! (Campaign coming soon to Kickstarter, LOL) Man is at once animal and rational, and sometimes the rational side reacts against our own animalistic urge to designate an alpha ape and worship only that one ape. Many of us got into technology as a way of breaking down this same kind of bullshit hierarchy that you can find in so many other places &amp; domains of human life. Technology was supposed to be the great equalizer. In some cases it has worked that way but in others it has only amplified the disequilibrium. It seems we can&#x27;t escape our inner ape. Therefore is it &quot;technologists&quot; to whom you should be appealing here for greater reverence? Maybe it&#x27;s not your technological side, but your ape side, that wants to be more reverent.",

Because he&#x27;s in a valuation-driven growth-only economy on which his businesses depend, it&#x27;s in his interest to serve as this focal point, and because &#x27;visionary&#x27; is an appealing story, the feedback loop gets set up and whirls into motion.

I like him better for that, but it&#x27;s true he doesn&#x27;t deserve the amount of credit he&#x27;s given, simply because that&#x27;s unrealistic. But, if he CEASES to be &#x27;that guy&#x27; and &#x27;the visionary sole leader and innovator&#x27;, it&#x27;s less of an appealing story, and his businesses would suffer.

    "text": "I toured the GM Lansing Delta Township assembly plant a few years ago where they make mid-size SUVs like the GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave, and Chevy Traverse. At the time, with a ton of robotic welders, sleds, etc. they were running 3 shifts and turning out 60 cars&#x2F;hour. Last year, Tesla sold 50,000 cars. It would take the Delta plant roughly a month to make that many. GM has ~15 equivalent plants worldwide. I love Tesla and am glad to see the NUMMI plant up and running again, but even their most ambitious sales plans for the next 10 years pale in comparison to business as usual for the major manufacturers. edit Curiosity got the better of me, so I looked up the 2015 sales figures for those 3 vehicles from that one plant. Acadia: 96,393; Traverse: 119,945; Enclave: 62,081. So roughly 280,000 SUVs produced at the one assembly plant last year without much fanfare.",

Why can&#x27;t we make these investments through democratically accountable teams, perhaps via some academic mechanism? #2: When you make a risky investment as an individual in a startup, you expect to get a commensurate return on that investment if the startup becomes successful in the marketplace.

    "text": "TLDR; I’ve claimed a few times that our futures library provides a zero-cost abstraction, in that it compiles to something very close to the state machine code you’d write by hand. To make that a bit more concrete: - None of the future combinators impose any allocation. When we do things like chain uses of and_then, not only are we not allocating, we are in fact building up a big enum that represents the state machine. (There is one allocation needed per “task”, which usually works out to one per connection.) - When an event arrives, only one dynamic dispatch is required. - There are essentially no imposed synchronization costs; if you want to associate data that lives on your event loop and access it in a single-threaded way from futures, we give you the tools to do so. This sounds quite badass and awesome. I&#x27;m not sure what other language implementations take this approach, but this is clearly an extremely beautiful, powerful, and novel (to me at least!) concept. Before reading this, I thought rust was great. This takes it to the next level, though.",

    "text": "In Rust it&#x27;s frequently the case that slow compilations are dominated by generating and optimizing LLVM IR. This codegen step (generating LLVM IR) often takes awhile just because we&#x27;re generating so much IR. Rust takes an approach with generic functions called monomorphization which means that we generate a new version of each function for each set of generics it&#x27;s instantiated with. This means that a future of a String will generate entirely different code from a future of an integer. This allows generics to be a zero cost abstraction because code is optimized as if you had substituted all the generics by hand. Putting all that together, highly generic programs will generally trend towards higher compile times. With all the generics in play, there tends to be a lot of monomorphization which causes quite a lot of LLVM IR to get generated. As with many aspects of Rust, however, you have a choice! Rust supports what we call &quot;trait objects&quot; which is a way to take a future and put it behind an allocation with a vtable (virtual dispatch). This forces the compiler to generate code immediately when a trait object is created, rather than down the line when something is monomorphized. Put another way, you&#x27;ve got control over compile times if you&#x27;re using futures. If you&#x27;re taking a future generically and that takes too long to compile, you can instead take a trait object (or quickly convert it to a trait object). This will help cut down on the amount of code getting monomorphized. So in general futures shouldn&#x27;t make compilation worse. You&#x27;ll have a choice between performance (no boxes) and compile times (boxing) occasionally, but that&#x27;s basically already the case of what happens in Rust today.",

The closest things in the standard to these rust futures, is of course std::future, which currently is very limited as it even lacks chaining and composition. The Concurrency TR (which eventually will be added to the standard, but sadly not for C++17) does provide these features (and more); multiple implementations have been are available for some time (boost, HPX, Folly, and some compiler vendors). The issues with std::future is that is far from zero cost, as it requires allocation (the control block is dynamically allocated), type erasure (the callback type is not part of the future) and synchronisation (as the promise can be fulfilled from another thread). Efficient implementations of std::future are possible but will never be as fast as what is shown in this rust library. On the other hand the SeaStar C++ library (I&#x27;m in no way involved, just a fan) already provides pretty much the same zero cost futures with a very similar implementation as it doesn&#x27;t try to follow the standard design.",

One quibble I have with this post is that it talks about futures as a zero-cost abstraction. That might be true (or close to true) from a performance perspective, but in my (admittedly inexperienced) opinion, it seems to have a significant ergonomic cost that is not accounted for. While futures help us deal with multi-threaded coordination of data from multiple sources, that overhead isn&#x27;t necessary for situations where you&#x27;re running in a single thread dedicated to doing IO operations. Dealing with futures in your code is not non-trivial. Browsing through the futures version of the HTTP server, I had a hard time following along: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexcrichton&#x2F;futures-rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;futur... And it requires a bunch of helper code to go with it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexcrichton&#x2F;futures-rs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;futur... The blog post mentions Tokio, another high-level abstraction on top of mio (by the same author). Because it doesn&#x27;t require the futures abstraction from top-to-bottom, it offers similar (maybe even a little better) performance with what, to my eyes, is far simpler code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;tokio-minihttp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;l... I&#x27;m still learning Rust and spend most of my time in JavaScript. The analogy I&#x27;d use is: imagine if in the Node programming model, every API required you to use JS Promises, even at the very lowest level. Even if you could reduce the cost of creating new Promise objects, interacting with them over simple values could make the code you write more verbose. In Rust, that problem is exacerbated by the much stricter type system and the fact that you have to do cross-thread coordination. I&#x27;m a total beginner to systems programming, and a lot of this stuff is above my pay grade. However this shakes out in the community, I&#x27;m very happy to see Rust on the way to becoming the fastest, most productive way to write high-performance web services.",

    "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply! I&#x27;m a little confused about the snippet you&#x27;re pointing out. It&#x27;s not actually using futures at all! In fact, that code is just part of setting up threads for the server. The reason it&#x27;s more complicated than the version in Tokio is that minihttp supports multiple event loop threads (which gives some performance benefits), and this code is handling that setup. At a broader level, Tokio&#x27;s services -- the main thing users write -- are based on futures, in exactly the same way as minihttp. So for people writing actual servers, the ergonomics should be the same. Now, stepping back, it&#x27;s definitely true that ergonomics are a cost to be aware of, and it&#x27;s one we&#x27;ve thought carefully about in the design of futures. We&#x27;ve had a lot of experience and success in Rust with iterators, which share a lot of the same API design philosophy. That said, I do anticipate that over time we&#x27;ll want to layer sugar on top of futures. As I mention a couple times in the blog post, async&#x2F;await (or something like it) is the obvious way to do it, and there&#x27;s plenty of prior art. But I think we should walk before we run -- let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;ve got the core abstraction right, and then we can sprinkle some sugar where it&#x27;s needed.",

Whenever I&#x27;ve debugged Go code this been validated. But yes, it&#x27;s not as clear cut. I ignored the threading runtime being a factor, and ignored that Java has a better GC (though it GCs more things). I also ignored JIT as steve pointed out to me in irc.

    "text": "You may find this makes somewhere more sense to think of it as ~5.3 microseconds per request for fasthttp vs. ~4.8 microseconds for Java vs. ~4.3 for Rust. It&#x27;s 40 microseconds or so for the standard lib Go. I&#x27;m just eyeballing the graph but this should be close enough (dominated by local CPU variances and such). Just as some people point out that &quot;gallons per mile&quot; is a more intuitively useful way of thinking, I think that at this scale &quot;overhead per request&quot; is a better way of thinking about it. I&#x27;m not generally a big fan of measuring the &quot;ping time&quot; response for web servers, but in this case I believe it is justified since we really are trying to establish that this future library is very fast. I fear, based on experience, that some developers well be looking at this and will sit there trying to choose fasthttp vs. rapidoid vs. minihttp based on this one graph, without considering what they really mean. Overhead-per-request I think makes it more clear that for the vast, vast majority of purposes, all of these, including Go and Node, are &quot;way way faster than your code&quot;, and unless you know you&#x27;re building a server where you seriously need to answer an API call at several hundred thousand responses per second, all of these are &quot;fast enough&quot; and the real criteria for choosing should be &quot;everything else&quot;. (One last edit... remember, it&#x27;s &quot;milli&#x2F;micro&#x2F;nano&quot;. Micro seems to be forgotten since it seems like many things that we care about fit into nano- or milli-. It&#x27;s quite a challenge in the web world to get your request out in under a millisecond usually, so .040 milliseconds added as HTTP overhead is rarely the problem.)",

    "text": "A &quot;zero-cost abstraction&quot; really means that abstraction doesn&#x27;t impose a cost over the optimal implementation of the task it is abstracting. Some things—like chaining a dynamic number of (arbitrary) closures—fundamentally require some sort of dynamic allocation&#x2F;construction, and so a zero-cost abstraction would be one that it only does that dynamic behaviour when necessary. If you don&#x27;t need the dynamic behaviour, the library is a zero-cost abstraction, by statically encoding all the pieces at the type level: like Rust&#x27;s iterators, each combinator function returns a new future type that contains all information about its construction and operations. To add to this, a closure in Rust is not a function pointer, each one a specialized struct containing exactly the captures, and thus this all gets put into the type information too, and everything can be be inlined together into a single pipeline. However, if you are dynamically constructing the future you&#x27;ll have to opt-in to a uniform representation for the parts (i.e. erase the type information about the different constructions). This does indeed require allocating and storing pointers, but AFAICT this is required in any implementation, i.e. this library imposes no&#x2F;little extra overhead over the optimal hand-written implementation. Furthermore, the static and dynamic parts can work together: if you have parts that are statically known, these can be constructed as a single static type (with no function pointers or allocations), and then boxed up into a dynamic future as a whole unit, which can then also form part of other static chains, meaning allocations and dynamic calls only need to happen when absolutely necessary.",

    "text": "Thanks for your reply. I&#x27;m still trying to understand what the restrictions look like. Say I sometimes have an outstanding asynchronous operation, i.e. validating some text in a document. I want to represent this by storing a Future representing this operation: struct Document { text:String, validating: Option&lt;Future&lt;Bool&gt;&gt; }; It seems like there&#x27;s a problem: in order to have a struct of this type, we need to have the type of the Future, but the only way to have the type of the Future is to create the Future (and here we have None). It this struct possible? How would I initialize it with {&quot;foo&quot;, None}?",

    "text": "As mentioned in the post, given Rust wants to operate in the same space as C, this approach makes sense. However from a higher level, building more complex concurrent systems, dealing with futures&#x2F;deferred-s&#x2F;promises and&#x2F;or a central select&#x2F;epoll&#x2F;kqueue reactor loop gets daunting and doesn&#x27;t mix with complex business rules. Deferred based approach has been a round for many years. I experienced it by using Twisted (Python framework) for 5 or so years. And early on it was great However when we switched to using green threads, the logic and amount of code was greatly simplified. So wondering if Rust provides any ability to add that kind of an N:M threading approach. Perhaps via an extension, macro or some other mechanism. Note that in C, it being C such things can be done with some low level trickery. Here is a library that attempt that: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;libmill.org&#x2F; And there were a few others before, but none have taken off enough to become mainstream.",

For actually writing an app, writing something higher-level makes sense: consider the relationship between raw futures and Finagle, for example. You have to build out the lower layers before you can add the upper ones, though. Rust doesn&#x27;t natively supply anything like green threads, as they have too heavy of requirements. But there are librarys that can implement them, since Rust is so low-level: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;mioco as an example.",

    "text": "I was thinking about clefs recently. Why are we so fixed on two clefs? All that a clef needs to do is to indicate (a) where the G is and (b) which octave it is in. When I play with ideas I just put a &#x27;x&#x27; on the G line with a superscript 4 next to it. Music theory could be taught in a way so that students learnt to find the G as a matter of course. But for some reason we&#x27;ve been beaten into thinking in terms of these two clefs. It might have something to do with the way a conductor reads full-score. With typesetting technology it should be mess important to have conductor and accompanist on the same clef. We&#x27;re not far from a point where everything could move to e-ink. It&#x27;ll probably take another century for music libraries to have been completely moved to digital.",

He had to go to the Union board who then had to talk to company management to not only give him a raise, but everyone else in his department that had the same position. This is what I&#x27;m talking about. Sure, there may be some union contracts, for some type of jobs, which require everyone in a firm with the same classification to be paid exactly the same. And, yes, union contracts as a rule prohibit individually-negotiated compensation, even where (as they usually do) they permit individual variations in compensation (usually, with defined criteria and processes.)

Currently, our stack runs on AWS with Python (Flask) and AngularJS on the front end. Experience with database architecture for big data applications is a huge plus. The key issues that we will face are: -Infrastructure security: We’re touching some of a corporation&#x27;s most sensitive data -System robustness: This will be mission-critical software for a company as they will base numerous marketing decisions on the information -Scalability: We will be working with massive data sets (millions of customers and hundreds of millions of transactions) and computationally intensive models If you&#x27;re looking for new engineering challenges, please contact justin@clvmetrics.com.",

This is quite difficult, consider the following: Problem: Outside organisms keep contaminating your pools of algae. Solution: cover them up. Problem: your reactor surface keeps fouling Solution: open it up and wash it Problem: Now you gotta clean the whole thing to make sure you don&#x27;t have contamination Problem: some parts of the pool are far denser in algae than others leading to inefficiency Solution: pump&#x2F;stir it! Problem: now you have to move huge volumes of water. Plus your equipment could foul&#x2F;breakdown Partial solution: solar powered pumps. Fouling still an issue though Problem: Organisms raised in water take a lot of water with them for the ride even when you spin&#x2F;filter them out for harvesting Partial solution: Dry it out with energy, maybe more sun? Now you need more space. After all this you have to wonder whether the cost and additional energy invested leaves you with enough left over to make sense.

    "text": "From what I have read it is only tied to the motherboard as others have pointed out. But to be clear the support conversation appears to be related to the free upgrade process. Sounds like the guy completed the free upgrade, swapped hardware out, and now he can&#x27;t reinstall Windows 10. Right or wrong, I can actually see Microsoft doing this. The free upgrade is just that, an upgrade. It is intended to install only as an upgrade on a system currently running an earlier version of Windows. If a hard drive was replaced and you needed to install Windows 10, you would have to either (a) install the full version - which would require a purchase; or (b) install an earlier version and go through the upgrade process again. The problem there is that Microsoft may only allow one upgrade per license key, in which case your previous upgrade voided that license key for future upgrades. It would be similar to having Windows XP running on your system and wanting to upgrade to Windows 7. You go out purchase the upgrade license (cheaper) so you can perform the upgrade. A few months later your hard drive crashes, you try to install from the upgrade license and are out of luck. You need to go through the upgrade process again or have a full version available.",

    "text": "It&#x27;s hard to be sure why exactly shared libraries and dynamic linking appeared. Your explanation about reducing file size for smaller HDD and RAM footprint is probably one of the reasons, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the only one - I don&#x27;t remember many shared libraries from MSDOS days (where with 2MB of RAM and 40MB of HDD, storage was really scarce). In fact - I don&#x27;t remember any libraries! To run Doom you just borrowed the floppies from a friend and it would 100% work. The same for Warcraft 1. I believe it&#x27;s more similar to Database Normalization from RDBMS world than to anything else. And the most important objective of Database Normalization is considered &quot;Freeing the database of modification anomalies&quot;. My own experience with shared libraries is pretty positive. I have fixed OpenSSL vulnerabilities many times by just updating the OpenSSL library and restarting all services. Compared to my own experience with docker where after waiting for a few weeks I had to change my base images (as nobody was updating them) updating just a single shared library and having the vulnerability fixed is way easier! This, of course, is true if those who maintain the software you use do care about backwards compatibility (which tends to be true for the &quot;boring&quot; stuff and false for the stuff considered &quot;cool&quot; - looking at you nodejs library developers who break my build at least once a month).",

    "text": "&gt; This is clearly wrong - I demonstrated a stupidly simple alternate theory which disagrees with the consensus, but still lacks constant power shifts. Your theory didn&#x27;t even explain the data (in the software industry), and had nothing to say about power. Basically, it can comfortably exist beside the consensus theory as a second-order effect (and the data actually looks like that is probably the case, explaining representation differences of up to 2:1). &gt; So why cling to that theory, rather than, say, my theory of p=A - B x math_content + second_order_corrections? Two reasons: 1. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the anomalous software industry (neither the very low participation nor the sudden change) while the consensus theory does, and 2. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the lack of representation (and possible correction after well-documented struggles) in fields of high prestige and little math (such as law, medicine and politics). In all those fields: law, medicine, politics and software, women participation was (or is) far lower than 30%. It was&#x2F;is lower than 20%. You might think that singling out software is uninteresting from a statistical perspective, as in Scott Alexander&#x27;s regression it was just a single (outlier) data point, but in fact, the software industry is larger than all &quot;heavy math content&quot; professions combined, and holds more power in today&#x27;s society. &gt; My theory predicts more things (e.g., it predicts % women in academia, % women in finance, % women in tech vs non-tech roles) and is vastly simpler. How is that not a win? Because it predicts fewer things, and not even what you claim it does. At best, it predicts fewer women than men in certain subjects, but that&#x27;s it. However, we see that while the binary relation &quot;fewer&quot; may remain, how much fewer decreases over time. Second, it only holds (even as a binary prediction) when you look at the past few decades -- far too short to look at social change -- which means it does not explain the exclusion of women from law, medicine and politics. Third, it does not explain the way-too-low representation in CS, nor the drop in participation. The consensus theory explains all of it, for any time duration. It even explains interesting shifts we see in, say, education (more women as prestige drops, while in CS fewer women as prestige rises). Yes, it&#x27;s more complicated, but fits reality better, plus it&#x27;s supported by lots and lots of data.",

I am not sure where you&#x27;re going with this, but you can&#x27;t make such a comparison at a given moment in time. The reason is that struggles usually follow power, and so it is likely that at any point in time, a marginalized group would concentrate its efforts to penetrate positions that imbue power. As the power structure shifts, so does the struggle. You can&#x27;t equate professions that hold different amounts of power at different times. Certainly up until some decades ago, law and medicine carried much more prestige and influence -- and hence, power -- than math and the physical sciences. In fact, software&#x27;s gain of prestige correlates quite well with the drop in women participation. It is quite anomalous in that the existence of the field long predated its power. Law and medicine, OTOH, are professions that have been seats of power for almost a millennium. A model that correlates low female participation with high power -- and later, increased participation after a struggle -- predicts both observations. It is not such a surprising or sophisticated theory; historians have seen this pattern so often that it is almost banal. This pattern is so regular, that it&#x27;s relatively easy for us to predict the future: fifty years from now, assuming the power wielded by software remains high, women participation will equal men&#x27;s, and it will be hard for people to believe that that hasn&#x27;t always been the case. Unfortunately, even though the result of the fight is certain, we still need to fight it. That is the price history exacts from us.",

Mirror for the ctrl+f folks ---------------------------------- Windows 10&#x27;s New Feature Steals Your Internet Bandwidth A couple of days ago I discussed a number of privacy and other concerns with Microsoft&#x27;s new Windows 10, made available as a free upgrade for many existing MS users: Windows 10: A Potential Privacy Mess, and Worse: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lauren.vortex.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;001115.html The situation has only been getting worse since then. For example, it&#x27;s been noted that the Win10 setup sequence is rigged to try fool users into switching to an MS browser, irrespective of their browser settings before they started the upgrade: Mozilla isn’t happy with Microsoft for changing how users change the default web browser in Windows 10: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft-news.com&#x2F;mozilla-isnt-happy-with-microsoft-... Pretty bad. But we have even lower to go, as we&#x27;ve seen that by default, Windows 10 actually steals bandwidth from your ISP connection so that Microsoft can use your computer, and your connection, to send MS updates to their other customers. Huh? Say what? Yep. It&#x27;s a devious little feature called Windows Update Delivery Optimization. It&#x27;s enabled by default. For Enterprise and Education users, it operates over the local LAN. For ordinary Home type users, Microsoft can send their data update goodies to potentially any PC on the global Internet -- from your PC, over your Internet connection. On your dime. We could get into the pros and cons of local updates being staged between local machines on a LAN as opposed to the outside Internet. But as soon as MS decided that it&#x27;s A-OK for them to use my Internet connection to cut down on their bandwidth costs serving their other customers -- without asking me for my specific permission first -- the situation blows into the red zone immediately. Microsoft makes the predictable excuses about this high-tech thievery. There&#x27;s a way you can turn it off. Yeah, buried down deep in the settings, assuming you even know about it in the first place. MS claims they only use your connection when it&#x27;s &quot;idle&quot; by their definitions. Thanks a bunch. Oh yes, and (how generous of them!) Microsoft notes that they won&#x27;t steal bandwidth this way from &quot;metered&quot; connections. But here&#x27;s the catch -- you have to manually indicate that a connection shouldn&#x27;t be used for MS&#x27; update delivery scheme. Otherwise, Microsoft has no way to know if (for example) you&#x27;re paying by the gigabyte or have a low bandwidth cap. Above all, the sheer arrogance of Microsoft to enable this bandwidth theft by default is stunning. I don&#x27;t care if they want to move 1K or 1gig to their other happy users, I want to damn well be asked permission first! Obviously, this general category of peer-to-peer data transfer is used on the Net in other contexts, such as torrents for example -- but that&#x27;s something you do voluntarily, of your own volition. Comcast uses the bandwidth of many Comcast users to turn modems in people&#x27;s homes into public Wi-Fi access points. This has been highly controversial, but at least Comcast is typically doing it over modems they supplied, and has claimed that they over-provision the connection speeds to take this into account -- and don&#x27;t apply that public usage against home users&#x27; bandwidth caps. But Microsoft didn&#x27;t even bother with such rationalizations. They simply said in essence: &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got bandwidth, so we&#x27;re gonna use it however we please unless you tell us differently. Suckers!&quot; If you&#x27;re running Windows 10, you may want to terminate this travesty. The settings you need are buried down in: START-&gt;Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security-&gt;Windows Update-&gt;Advanced options, under: Choose how updates are delivered. It&#x27;s worth noting at this point that if Google had tried a stupid stunt like this, there would likely already be EU commissioners running through the streets of Brussels hoisting pitchforks and flaming torches, all yelling for Google&#x27;s blood. For a while there, it was starting to look like there indeed was a new kind of Microsoft coming into view, one that had evolved beyond the hubris that had so long been Microsoft&#x27;s single most defining characteristic. As we can see, any such hopes are now ... Gone with the Win10. --Lauren-- I have consulted to Google, but I am not currently doing so. All opinions expressed here are mine alone.",

Lots of real-world samples follow the normal distribution, and anything that does should look roughly like that sim. So there&#x27;s no real need to use random numbers, but it&#x27;s a very quick way of me getting data that looks like real data and I know I&#x27;ve got the standard deviation &amp; mean correct and that there should be no anomalies. My sim can only show one side of the story though, it can&#x27;t show how often real issues are picked up. For that, we&#x27;d probably want to look at real-world data and investigate each reported issue to see what proportion are important (and then possibly try and see how many were missed).",

    "text": "I&#x27;m really just tripping on nostalgia right now but fuck it someone might appreciate these details so I&#x27;m going to continue. I also remember playing so many good stuff on the Ti-83. We used to download Bubble bobble and even 3d wolfenstein and just slack off. Students did cheat using the Ti-83 by putting formulas and cheat notes. I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t ban it. It was expensive at the time too and I lost or broke mine twice. I&#x27;m not sure if all Canadian high schools were like ours but we had dedicated courses for learning everything from Qbasic to Maya. I was mad jealous of kids that were creating crazy 3d animations with 3ds max but the class was always filled very fast :(. Had I learned the stuff I might have become a computer graphics artist or something in that area. The course I took taught Visual Basic and then QBasic towards the end (I was like dayum I already know this at age 10, let me play web games while teacher is not looking). At lunch time computer graphics lab hosted Counter Strike (1.3 back then) where you paid a dollar to play for 45 minutes and sometimes after school it would go until for several hours. Like jam packed with 20 people screaming and shouting when somebody got knifed. You couldn&#x27;t curse tho because the instructor was a hard ass and kicked people out for typing swear words in the chat. Damn, we even had Battlefield 1942 tournaments. Ironically, being in a poorer school meant ton of corporate endorsements and goodies (free Vancouver Grizzlies tickets &amp; free lunch). During the mid 90s when I was in elementary school, our school had everything from Apple II to Imac. Like almost every Mac from different timeline. One of my favorite was a black &amp; white tiny monitor Apple that had Hypercard on it and I used to create something like dragonball Z stick figure animation (obviously inspired by stickdeath.com) on it. Fuck those were good times especially since I didn&#x27;t have a computer back then and the school provided all these things. In grade 6, our teacher was super supportive of us using technology (he was into tech, even bought a monochrome projector off ebay so he could teach material from the computer). Looking back I can see how fortunate it was to have experienced all these things. I was especially fond of playing games like Lode Runner and Lemonade Stand on the Apple II. Pretty much all of my recess and lunchtime was spent on figuring out 1) find games in dusty bins in school gym 2) figure out how to run it. Our school used to host Zip Zap Map Canada (tetris meets geography) tournaments. At home my dad taught me how to create my own website (so 1997 or 1998) using Netscape Composer (on win 95 or 98) and uploading it to a free host. Used to brag about it and impressed my teacher a lot. I picked up a book on HTML for dummies from the library and started reading about Javascript and Java but these books were in Korean and I had a tough time. Eventually geocities came along and it was day dreaming about making a popular website ( never happened :( ). During this time, we got fresh new iMacs and it was off to the races to find games to run on it, Bugdom, Nanosaur, Sim City Classic &amp; 2000, weird game where you walk around a dungeon and kill monsters and level up. We were also trying to run some weird emulation that supposedly allowed us to play windows games but at super low fps. Everything was going good until one day thieves came in stole all 6~10 iMacs from our classroom. It was shitty but it was also a shitty neighborhood (think Compton without any rap song about it). My grade 6 teacher was really crushed. We got another batch of iMacs and this time we had cables to hold down the iMacs in case someone tried to jack it again and they came in with cable cutters and made off with it AGAIN. Finally they created a dedicated iMac lab on the second floor classroom where thieves couldn&#x27;t break into. Quite a long thread stemming from BASIC lol.",

FG-4592 (and a number of similar compounds) have been on the prohibited list since the beginning of 2015. The list can be seen at the list below, and it is extremely comprehensive. Several other substances are not currently prohibited, but are monitored for their possible use as performance enhancing drugs. Alongside track and field athletes, cyclists are the most tested athletes in any sport, and are subject to three core testing regimes. Firstly, cyclists are subject to in-competition testing. The winner of any race (or the stage of a race) and a random sample of other riders will be subject to blood or urine tests. Secondly, the whereabouts program requires cyclists to notify the authorities of their location every day to facilitate out-of-competition testing. Athletes are randomly sampled, with extra scrutiny paid to the strongest performers. Thirdly, the biological passport scheme creates a long-term profile of a rider&#x27;s physiology, to track changes in markers like testosterone&#x2F;epitestosterone ratio and hematocrit that may indicate the use of performance enhancing drugs or methods. A sudden change in any of these markers or deviation outside normal ranges is grounds for sanctioning. In all tests, two samples are taken to safeguard against anomalous measurements or failures in the chain of custody. A portion of both samples is stored indefinitely, to facilitate retroactive testing if new drugs or methods are discovered. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;files&#x2F;wada...",

None of these proprietary platforms have the reach of the web. No computing device maker can release a credible device without web support. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you have, you can&#x27;t make your proprietary platform cross the chasm the web has crossed. Apple can&#x27;t do it, even open-source Android can&#x27;t do it, because Android is runtime, not a standard. The common narrative of PC app -&gt; Web app -&gt; Mobile app is only superficially accurate in terms of where the tech hype was at different points. But in terms of long-term life cycles, mobile apps are much more like PC apps, and the web is something else completely different, which we&#x27;ve never seen before, and mark my words, it will not disappear or be superseded anytime soon.",

Generally conductors have something called the &#x27;skin&#x27; effect, which is that as they conduct the electrons move along the outer surface. So the skysphere&#x27;s outer surface forms a ring where the current will move out to the edge, and then back to the center before going into the ground (or more literally coming from the ground but that is not important here). The change in current in the outer rings will create a magnetic pulse inside the ring that is proportional to the change in current, per Ampere&#x27;s law. And for conductors that are inside the sphere part, they will experience a very large change in magnetic flux, which will then induce an electric current in any conductors they have inside of them. It is entirely possible that every piece of electronic equipment inside the sphere will be destroyed by the resulting EMP. Or simply magnetized. But I&#x27;d really want to compute flux lines based on the lightning hitting the top, splitting down for four &#x27;rings&#x27; (Kirkoff&#x27;s law) and then going on down via the center into the earth.",

When this happens find myself daydreaming or finding other things to do that are not work related. The real problem comes though at about 10-11pm and I get a huge burst of energy and focus to start working. I am left with a choice to stay up later and get work done, or go to bed and wake up earlier to catch up on work I missed. If I do decide to go to bed I will lay there for an hour or so just thinking about work and what I need to get done. With that said, last year I was talking to my doctor about it at my annual physical. He suggested I exercise more often. So for about the last 6-7 months I have made a conscious effort that whenever I feel like I am starting to struggle I will go out for at least a 30 minute walk. I usually end up taking about 4-5 a day. There is definitely a direct correlation between the amount I walk and my productivity. And I am starting to sleep a whole lot better at night.

The academic view seems that things weren&#x27;t that awful until 1931, when a large Austrian bank failed (Google Creditanstalt), which triggered a wave of global bank failures [1]. The resulting lack of credit was the cause that made the depression Great. When Creditanstalt went down, Dow was off ~50% from its 1929 high, which still happens every now and then. We went through a similar decline during the 2007-08 financial crisis and came out all right thanks to aggressive and globally organized central bank activity. Unfortunately such an organized response didn&#x27;t happen in the 1930s so the economies kept contracting, and the Dow eventually ended up losing 90%. Check out the charts in that period, it is fascinating. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fraser.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;meltzer&#x2F;bermac95.pdf",

    "text": "Absolutely positutly FALSE. First of all development of Ares has only recently been reinvigorated by LG devoting assets to the project which HP had taken a dump on when they pretty much gave up on WebOS. EnyoJS is rock-star tech that rock-stars refuse to look at close enough to realize it is what facebook wants react to be - but 10 years ago, and is now the only truly platform independent JS framework. Much work has been done by the LG designers as far as UI (I have followed their often ignored progress very closely of late) and the architecture of Enyo. It is commonly misunderstood due to media sensationalism that LG &quot;aquired&quot; WebOS and it&#x27;s goodies - NO NO NO - what they did is &quot;aquired&quot; the rights to utilize WebOS, along with the rights to own HP&#x27;s nifty little office building in San Francisco (to house LG&#x27;s nifty designers and devs) all under the agreement that they would pay an outrageous amount of money for these nifty items, and furthermore, that LG would slave away at WebOS&#x2F;Enyo so that HP doesn&#x27;t have to, all the while so that HP can benefit from the fruits since HP still owns WebOS&#x2F;Enyo and friends. Phewwwwww Just don&#x27;t say things like &quot;too bad LG is murdering WebOS and Enyo&quot; because it makes me feel sad and angry and contributes to the propaganda machine of dis-information regarding the details of the deal between LG&#x2F;HP (the details which have been hashed out in a secret agreement BTW) - this doesn&#x27;t help things as the media was left with no choice but to sensationalize it even more, and without the benefit of the facts of the deals terms to at least sprinkle some truth around too.",

Why? That&#x27;s not the thing we should be worried about, or at least that&#x27;s the point I got from the article. The thing we should be worried about is the way machine learning is applied in the here-and-now: the ethics of big data social networks, the robustness of complex (API-driven) systems, and so on. I fully agree that these issues are much more pressing and worrying than some emergent super-intelligence. But I thought the article was weak in its discussion of dreams, creativity, and linear &quot;flat data&quot;. It links to a June 2015 popular mechanics article about applying a genetic search optimization algorithm to discover gene regulatory networks, downplaying it as not-true-intelligence. But it does not mention deep neural networks and their higher-dimensional abstractions, particularly the psychedelic &quot;inception&quot; images. The author also mentions &quot;linear reasoning&quot;, and says he expects we&#x27;ll learn more about intelligence from stem cell and Alzheimer&#x27;s research, and the &quot;tissues surrounding neurons, and the roles they play in contextual regulation.&quot; As if to set up some dichotomy between machine and biological intelligence. But what about deep neural networks?? I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect the author&#x27;s arguments, but I&#x27;d like to see it discussed.",

Another cool application is the superconductors in the NMR devices. They can see what is inside your head and even do something equivalent to a chemical analysis (with NRM spectroscopy) without opening it. The first superconductors experiments used Helium at 4K, so they were only a laboratory curiosity. For everyday use, I like the giant magnetoresistance. This is my favorite case to explain that strange quantum effects have real world direct applications. Just start talking about the spin in electrons. Then explain that some magnetic conductors have a different value of the current with spin up and the currents with spin down. Then add the sandwich with non-magnetic conductors. At this moment it looks like a weird laboratory experiment. Then suddenly explain how it is used in hard disks heads: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giant_magnetoresistance",

So after crimping, the only way they hold together is with solder. There are no applications where this is better. Every connector manufacturer I know recommends against doing it. You can get away with doing it if you support the soldered end against vibration, but you should do that anyway. It&#x27;s really a training issue. People haven&#x27;t been taught better and there is a lot of bad advice floating around hobbyist forums. I have only been using good crimping tools for the last few years since I started making a product with a 50-conductor harness. Until I spent $200 on a crimping tool and took the time to research how to make good crimps (Molex has an excellent document), I never realized how they were supposed to look. Now most of my tools are used, purchased at auctions of dead companies, but I have $400 crimping tools I paid pennies on the dollar for. Even so, I normally farm out crimping to a company that does it with automated machinery, better and faster than I can do by hand.",

    "text": "Great points and great blog too. Paradoxically I think what&#x27;s missing is more manned space exploration - people have a genuine interest in seeing other planets and knowing about space in general, but this interest is tempered by the painful awareness that that we will never get to visit them, so that it&#x27;s like being on an island with a tall tower and a great telescope (through which we can see enticing other places) but no way of building a boat. Of course going into space is so expensive and so few of us would make the cut as astronauts that hardly anyone realistically expects to become a space explorer, but we would like to live vicariously through other space explorers, but this isn&#x27;t possible if our explorers never go anywhere. I think the reason people get so wrapped up in the story of the Mars rovers and the Rosetta&#x2F;Philae mission was that those probes are the most relateable things since people walked on the Moon in the 1970s. Really, I think we should be doing manned Moon missions regularly. People point out that there&#x27;s nothing on the Moon that we want, which is sort of true (although we&#x27;ve learned so much since the last time we went that we should reconsider that angle) but that&#x27;s a dreadfully consumerist mindset. The Moon is a (relatively) accessible destination that we could use as a proving ground for interplanetary exploration techniques. But more importantly, making regular visits or having a permanent outpost there gives people something to project their imaginations onto (including their political and technological imagination). I have a small collection of old newspapers and my favorite is one published the day after the first Moon landing with the simple headline &#x27;Men on Moon&#x27;. Reading it still gives me a shiver of excitement, followed by disappointment that we abandoned Moon exploration by the mid 1970s. One often-forgotten detail of the Moon landing was that at the time there was a Russian observer spacecraft orbiting the Moon, and it dropped down to within 10 miles of the surface at the time of the landing (presumably to observe what the Americans were up to). I saw Neil DeGrasse Tyson on Charlie Rose last week and he was joking that his favorite daydream is meeting the Chinese President at a conference and persuading him to leak a fake memo saying China aims to land a man on Mars, which would galvanize the American body politic back into serious investment in space. Sad but true.",

    "text": "Oh goodie, I love these questions. I&#x27;m going to assume the following is true about you: 1. You can translate someone&#x27;s desires for a product into a software spec. 2. You can translate a spec into a real, working piece of software by programming it using your favorite languages and tech stack. 3. You can do the above in a reasonable amount of time, reliably and consistently, and follow a project deadline with milestones without too much supervision. 4. Your friend is asking for this because he wants to market it as part of a product or service. Great! If you want to be fair to him and give him &quot;mate&#x27;s rates&quot; then charge him $2000 per week. Why $2000 per week? Here is the logical progression: 1. You have the aforementioned, assumed skills (which I am deducing from you being a developer of 3 - 4 years) that make you very valuable. 2. Your floor for making an iOS app for a client would be $5000 per week. Why? Because it&#x27;s mostly arbitrary and it&#x27;s what the market would pay, and I assure you the market would bear someone of your skills being paid this much money. 3. $2000 per week is a vastly discounted rate from the $5000 figure quoted above, which is appropriate for friends. Note that this is appropriate for friends working together as business partners, not for something so insignificant that a friend is doing it pro bono. That you want to be paid at all indicates this situation is not the latter. When I do technical consulting I always bill weekly. I fundamentally disagree with billing hourly for a variety of reasons, so I think you&#x27;re right that you should not be billing hourly. If you don&#x27;t want to bill weekly you can set an entire project fee. In that case, I would take the above amount and multiply it by the number of weeks you anticipate working. What I would emphasize to you is that pricing is basically arbitrary. You simply charge the highest amount the market will bear. If this project is worth doing and &quot;serious&quot; enough to warrant you being paid, you might as well be paid generously, even if it is very discounted for a friend.",

I&#x27;m used to it, honestly, because it&#x27;s become obvious over time that holding an opinion in contrast to what HN wants to hear is a nearly guaranteed ticket to comment illegibility. HN is the only forum on which I participate where disagreement is acceptably expressed as making someone&#x27;s thoughts more difficult to read. I&#x27;m merely presenting my (long earned) observations on Reddit. I absolutely think it&#x27;s a shitshow, a terrible place full of terrible people, but I suspect I&#x27;m being punished for daring to suggest that there is something wrong with the site itself. In the smaller subreddits, there are absolutely small embers of really powerfully rewarding conversation. There is stuff worth saving on Reddit, and I think the loud stuff drowns it out. I&#x27;ve had extremely fulfilling conversations about network security, application security, game modification, and polyamory in the various communities of which I am a part, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot. My experience isn&#x27;t representative because I subscribe to nearly zero default subs. To your point, I think SRS serves as the complete counterexample to everything you&#x27;re saying. The entire purpose of SRS is to brigade and single out individual Redditors, and I&#x27;ve seen the results firsthand. If FPH was doing it, there isn&#x27;t a universe in existence where SRS gets off that hook and it makes sense. Transparency is important here, as you say.",

    "text": "My point, and perhaps I was unclear, is that people seem happy to exchange the costs of density for the benefits of density (trains and airports; lots of varied good provided; many different kinds of jobs from many different employers; etc), ie, that there are no &quot;density issues&quot; with cities, it&#x27;s just that people really want to live on top of each other as much as the rapidly rising costs seem to indicate, and we haven&#x27;t adjusted to this idea as a society yet from our older vision of sparse open West and the American frontier (or pick your local myths). The post I was replying to implied that people were somehow forced in to cities -- it&#x27;s just untrue. They could be lots of other places, they just choose to be in cities. (Nothing in my post was about how cities nucleated, and was entirely about why cities have the rising costs they do, which reflect a HUGE demand for more city rather than a demand for out of the city.) I didn&#x27;t mean that if you found a unicorn, they wouldn&#x27;t prefer it, just that at the end of day, people made the compromise of plowing their fields with horses, not narwhals. Focusing on the horn as &quot;man, that would be a great feature to add!&quot; misses something interesting in why they picked the horse to the (perhaps arguably) more majestic narwhal. I would even argue that studying why the preference when you split the unicorn in to extant beings is the paramount question about the topic, since it gives us the seeds to move forward building more dense (and enjoyable!) cities and societies. I find it interesting that despite everyone lamenting how they wish they weren&#x27;t in cities, they don&#x27;t take any of the many opportunities to move to smaller cities or out of cities all together, despite there being many such chances. (Some people do, obviously, and are quite happy with their choice. I just meant that there was a net flow in to cities.) In so far as you point out that cities seem to top out a certain size that doesn&#x27;t hit any inherent physical constraints, our daydreaming about unicorns (and more importantly, our discussion of horse versus narwhal) serves to improve these limits and let us move towards more focused centers of human activity. The information age (and really... modern humans for ~10,000 years) has been driven largely by focused human intelligence, of which cities -- being a natural focal point of human efforts -- have played center stage. The story of humanity since the ice age can be glibly phrased as: we found a way to stay in one place, and grew; we found a way to get power more efficiently, and got denser, and grew; we made many theoretical breakthroughs about the mechanics of getting, storing, transporting, and using power, and got denser, and grew. The past few centuries have been a concerted effort on externalizing our various faculties, following a series of breakthroughs on fundamentals, and as a result we&#x27;ve been able to double the population in just the past ~100 years. People have picked up on the narrative, even if they don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s happening, yet. They enjoy getting to be part of the important cluster of human activity, instead of relegated to energy production out on a farm. tl;dr: You made an uncharitable reading of my posts, and failed to connect that I was using &quot;enjoy&quot; as a euphemism for the idea of a &quot;utility&quot; function, because I was talking in public, and wanted my idea to be generally understood rather than technically sound. This error in parsing my post led you to make a long rant -- concurring with me. Your violent agreement amused me, so I wrote you a rant back. [Ed: Or just flat out missed I was talking about why the skyrocketing prices, not the nucleation of new cities.] Hope you&#x27;re having a good day. (:",

This achieves a few things: it kills off any other bacteria that may be in the milk and it denatures the milk protein so that it sets thicker. Costco milk is probably pasteurized at a high enough temperature that this isn&#x27;t necessary, but I&#x27;ve always done it this way. Yogurt is really forgiving. I&#x27;ve daydreamed a bit about making a temperature regulator for my crock with an Arduino or similar, but it&#x27;s honestly not necessary. People get good results simply wrapping a jar with towels.",

On the other side I removed all the JSON things and the Pub&#x2F;Sub (IMHO is interesting to subscribe to areas to see objects entering&#x2F;exiting them, not much to position updates since it&#x27;s the same of doing PUBLISH+GEOADD from the client side). Added: GEOHASH to return a Geohash standard string from of a given element, mainly for interoperability. I&#x27;m also adding GEODIST (to calculate distances) and GEOPOS (to retrieve latitude&#x2F;longitude of objects without the need to query for radius). The work will be available in the context of Redis 3.2, unless I get mad and merge back into 3.0, which is unlikely but not impossible. EDIT: before of three days ago I was not aware of Geohashing at all, so if you have five mins to check the code, I&#x27;ll be glad :-) Thanks. I&#x27;m pretty confident that it&#x27;s ok now after I added a fuzzy test that replicates the feature (by brute forcing distance computation) in Tcl that checks against the Redis output, but still... EDIT2: wanted to add that I&#x27;m very glad Matt efforts are not going to be wasted and we are finally merging this.",

There is the new AI blogging system, but that is more of a try and walk away scenario. I would have little control, so it has no use in the long run. d. The back-end is open source in nodeJs. This isn&#x27;t necessarily the best backend language they could have used, but I know how to make changes so it is the best for me. With that, it is completely extendable. You don&#x27;t like the tagging system, bring in your own. Want comments? You have like ten different pre-built options, or you can write your own with firebase or any other technology. I could go on forever, but you get the point. e. I am not sure if I hate anything, but their default rendering&#x2F;routing system is a little janky. I would prefer angular, as it has a little more finesse. f. Not really, I had read through all of the documentation and GitHub issues before ever starting, which I would recommend doing for all technology. It is a solid option if you have javascript experience, but there are many other options, including just writing your own. With things like loopback, and AngularJs Backbone&#x2F;Marionette, and EmberJs, the ability to build something as simple as a blogging system is like a week long affair at most. Especially if you ignore things like user-defined templates, and any other feature that would make more sense in a SaaS CMS. You can see the blog up now, if you disregard the URL.

Her brother, Cherokee was an NBA player at the time and from my place in the pit, Corey Parks looked about seven feet tall. The combination of the very tall and imposing Corey Parks playing bass on one side, combined with Ruyter Sighs playing guitar on the other was very powerful. Nashville Pussy&#x27;s lead singer and drummer were both men, but Ruyter Sighs&#x27; flat out amazing guitar playing really drove the sound. Are they a girl band or a male band? Or, what about Sonic Youth? Are they are a girl band or a male band? Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore decided they wanted to start making music, so they recruited Lee Ranaldo and eventually found a drummer. Kim Gordon was just as much a creative force as any of the men she played with and when she finally put her bass down, lo and behold, she was a damned good guitar player. Or, how about Bikini Kill? Are they a girl band or a male band? They&#x27;re most heavily associated with riot grrl and are mostly considered Kathleen Hanna&#x27;s band, but Billy Karren was a straight up incredible guitar player. If there was any justice, he would be recognized as one of the truly great musicians to come out of that soon to be famous Washington scene. Or, in a different genre, are the Cocteau Twins a girl band or a male band? I simply can&#x27;t imagine that band without Elizabeth Fraser nor would I want to. Debbie Googe and Bilinda Butcher have been members of My Bloody Valentine since the late 1980s and I simply can&#x27;t imagine what MBV would sound like without those two amazing women. Their other two members are male. Are they a girl band or a male band? Or, Slowdive? Rachel Goswell formed the band in the late 80s with a guy she knew since she was a kid. Are they a girl band or a male band? More personally, my sister is in a thrash metal band. A woman I dated several years back used to play drums in a weird shoegaze&#x2F;electronic fusion band.",

One helpful data point could be whether the library supports a (formal) custom build apparatus, since you can often get a sizable reduction that way. Full jQuery UI clocks in at ~242K, but using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jqueryui.com&#x2F;download&#x2F; you can often strip it down to 20K or less. Similarly with THREE.js and several others. Going in the other direction, a library that seems small (Backbone.js, @ ~20K) may actually end up being relatively heavy because of required external dependencies. A more explicit side-by-side &quot;compare&quot; function would also be nice here, comparing library size along with other metrics like script loader compatibility, maintenance frequency, different flavors of popularity, etc.",

    "text": "A few of the people making these claims are actually in the field. This does not cause me to take them seriously. Unless there is something secret in a government black project, there has been almost no progress on AGI... at all... ever. We have narrow domain specific algorithms that can ape intelligence in limited domains, but only if they are front loaded by human intelligent designers with a priori knowledge about the meta structure of those domains. There is one class of algorithms that shows some general learning behavior: evolutionary algorithms. Ironically these are the least favored algorithms by CS AI people. I&#x27;ve heard those who work on them made fun of. It&#x27;s because while GP&#x2F;EC shows general ability it does so at such prodigious cost in compute cycles that it takes supercomputing resources to get it to do anything interesting. This makes evolutionary algorithms uncompetitive with fast but narrow search and optimization algorithms designed to solve specific problems.",

    "text": "It&#x27;s true that objectivity is in some senses a myth and that everybody has a biased perspective. It&#x27;s also true that when you directly contradict someone else&#x27;s perspective, you can expect push-back from them. The reaction of dang and others here is ample evidence of that. Getting in shouting matches makes your argument much, much less effective, not to mention making the forum for those shouting matches an unpleasant place to be. Instead of saying &quot;No, you stupid douchebag&quot;, why not phrase your argument in terms of &quot;Yes, and...&quot;? Instead of posting screeds about how early employees of startups get screwed, why not phrase it as &quot;Startup founders could solve many of their hiring problems by offering meaningful equity - not just a few percent, but enough that a successful exit is life-changing for all their early employees. This would also fix incentive alignment problems and ensure that employees keep working hard even when they&#x27;re not in the same room as the boss.&quot; You might find some unlikely allies, even among the likes of Sam Altman [1] or Andrew Mason [2]. Or instead of complaining about how Evan Spiegel is an undeserving twat who represents everything wrong with the VC industry, why not highlight the startups whose products you believe are deserving, evangelize them to friends and acquaintances, intro them to people who may help them, and help ensure that the next founder who ends up with a unicorn deserves it? As you&#x27;ve said before, negative information never gets erased, you have to &quot;flood the channel&quot; [3]. The connection that you didn&#x27;t make is that negative information (and its ensuing push-back) also reflects negatively on the person who posted it, since most readers are intelligent and can assume that there&#x27;s more to the story than the side that was posted. Flood the channel with positive information, not negative. You&#x27;ll find that it becomes much, much easier to achieve your goals.

    "text": "I think it&#x27;s easier to explain this in terms of likelihood theory. Likelihood is the probability of observed data GIVEN A SPECIFIC MODEL. This is NOT to be confused with the probability of a specific model being correct GIVEN THE OBSERVED DATA. It is the later probability that people want to really know, but confusing it with the former probability can have catastrophic consequences in fields like medicine, engineering, jurisprudence, finance and insurance. The problem is related to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Fallacy ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prosecutor%27s_fallacy ): &quot;Consider this case: a lottery winner is accused of cheating, based on the improbability of winning. At the trial, the prosecutor calculates the (very small) probability of winning the lottery without cheating and argues that this is the chance of innocence. The logical flaw is that the prosecutor has failed to account for the large number of people who play the lottery.&quot; There is a mathematical statistics professor at the University of Toronto named D.A.S. Fraser ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utstat.utoronto.ca&#x2F;dfraser&#x2F; ) who is an expert in likelihood theory and has commented on this issue: &quot;...statistics does have the answer! The answer is contained in the p-value function from likelihood theory: p(delta) Here delta is the relevant parameter with delta_0 as the null value and delta_1 as the alternative needing detection. Then p(delta_0) is the observed p-value, p(delta_1) is the detection probability, and the rest is judgement: the route to the Higgs boson.&quot;",

We currently do have one data center, but this design allows us to bring others online. If the datacenter was hit by a meteor all our customers would get an email blast urging them to create a local backup immediately. The chances that both the DC and the user would get hit by the same natural disaster are relatively small. Still, it&#x27;s not a storage service like S3 so geo-redundancy plays a smaller role. We do plan on building out other datacenters in the future, but since we&#x27;re bootstrapped, we have to do that when the time is right, otherwise it would be very easy to over-extend ourselves and start losing money. edit -&gt; I ignored your Backblaze dev question, sorry. We have multiple processes running at all times on the pods, and they go shard-by-shard. We&#x27;re always optimizing, but the short answer is, we&#x27;re always looking for errors.",

Furthermore, it was not originally designed with this usecase in mind. All those contribute to it feeling a lot more awkward for this purpose than other, better designed, solutions.

(1) Availability (Something fails eventually), both in terms of monitoring (Find out) and failover (How to resolve when this happens?) (2) Security (Who had access to which key when? Are they still at the company? Where&#x27;s the audit trail? Third-party managed security credentials ... can you say side-channel?) (3) Legal jurisdiction (Are we allowed to put x in y location? Do we want government x using law y to potentially perform action z ?) (4) Latency (Site x on provider y is experiencing a DDoS) (5) Heterogeneous management (What happens if something auto-managed gets manually-managed for awhile? Do things break?) (6) Resource lead time and failure impact (What happens when the hardware you just wanted to spin up from the endless cloud supply isn&#x27;t available?) (7) Actual performance characteristics (Usually every provider offers only a specific selection of environments and offers weak to no SLAs&#x2F;guarantees on real world performance.) ... and so on. A lot of these are sort of cloud restatements of the RFC1925[1] fundamental truths of networking. Also, this is all docker-specific, so it hinges on people wanting to build their infrastructure on a self-described insecure and immature platform and tie their whole management paradigm to it. FWIW, I am still working on an OS and virtualization platform agnostic alternative devops process management tool[2] and am trying to get my company to agree to open source it. It can easily wrap docker, having far broader scope, and was designed to be future-proofed... it is thus potentially useful for embedded dev, the BSDs, real hardware, clusters, etc. It takes a very different paradigm to docker, abstracting cloud providers, services and platforms separately, and allowing the former to figure out how to connect and manage the other two internally... with standardized interfaces for major operations and notifications.

There were a number of relatives and friends visiting and myself someone that shared my love of computing were in the there programming away, and really programming, we are talking assembler here. And after a couple of hours we came down to the living room and everyone had the TV on channel 3 and everyone was watching us (I did not realize the splitter was broadcasting throughout the cable in our house). I guess there was nothing better on back them before cable had 100&#x27;s of channels.

I forget exactly what it was but it was something like &quot;Java Python Flash Linux game developer&quot; or whatever. I had learned about this from an out-of-the-blue client lead who emailed me. I was shocked when he said that&#x27;s how he found me. I then went around to about a dozen different computers, different types, different geo locations in my state, both auth&#x27;ed and anonymous, and sure enough I always came up as top result, first page. It was... an awesome time to be taking on contract&#x2F;consulting work, let me tell you. So many more leads coming in than before. Not enough hours in the week&#x2F;month to help them, had to turn down otherwise interesting gigs. Then it came to an end. Rug pulled out. Woke up one day, rankings changed, no longer on top like that. Lesson (one anyway): that&#x27;s a huge eyeball funnel. bazillions of people doing searches. even getting a tiny slice of it means tons of eyeballs stumbling upon you. quality is important, of course, being great at what you do, having the right leads, a good fit, avail, etc. But quantity?

    "text": "If Rosetta had an operations crew nearby - even just one person - the cost of the mission would have been, what, 100x greater? Surely enough more expensive to pay for multiple robotic probes. Total mission cost for Rosetta = 1.4 billion Euros. It costs something like $50,000&#x2F;kg for GEO, so I&#x27;ll use that as the baseline. The Orion capsule weighs 21 tons and the Deep Space Habitat at least 50 tons. Add one person and the 5 kg of consumables per day, for a mission of 300 days, gives another 2 tons. That&#x27;s $3 billion already, or 2.4 billion Euros. Now add the development costs, support staff, communications, etc. and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to send a small fleet of redundant probes than to send a single human. To double check, an Orion capture of an asteroid in an orbit close to Earth&#x27;s is $2.6 billion (see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orion_%28spacecraft%29#Explorat... ), again, excluding development costs. In any case, we have no way to put a human on the same orbit as a comet, much less return the human safely to Earth, so only a robot mission is possible.",

    "text": "I prefer well known memory lifetimes, but I&#x27;m undecided about ARC (or somewhat equivalently: std::shared_ptr, etc.). It can be a little confusing and overwrought at times, and I don&#x27;t think the lifetimes are as clear as they could be. IMO, more languages shouldn&#x27;t assume that there is a single memory allocator. That&#x27;s one of the worst assumptions I see in systems languages -- even C++ (before C++11) got this entirely wrong. Swift gets this wrong, Go gets this wrong. Rust is probably a little better because it actually has a static idea of memory scope, but I haven&#x27;t seen a way to swap out the memory allocator in various contexts. Most projects I&#x27;ve been involved with have used region&#x2F;arena allocators. Not only do you mostly avoid the non-determism of your average GC, but you avoid the hassle of fine grained reference counting (in most cases). This relies on you choosing the scopes for your regions appropriately, but there usually is a clear scope to attach things to (e.g. frames, iteration of an event loop, etc.).",

    "text": "(I&#x27;m the author&#x2F;founder.) Old one did distributed breadth-first graph exploration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zerotier&#x2F;ZeroTierOne&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OLD-Multicast-A... It was nifty and cool and worked pretty well for small to mid tier stuff, but biggest disadvantages in practice were: (1) Peers seem to drop the potato more often than I predicted when I simulated it, leading to a lot of truncated propagations. It also has no geo-awareness, so if your propagation graph goes through sub-Saharan Africa you&#x27;re likely to see a lot of packet loss. I think my simulations implicitly assumed all high-end first-world broadband links, when reality includes the whole world and a lot of slow&#x2F;crummy cellular. (2) High latency, which caused problems for people who wanted low-latency multicast for SDN-type applications (enterprise stuff). In the beginning I never considered those applications, but they&#x27;re emerging as a major user base. (3) Imposed a high CPU cost, since to prevent flooding every packet had to be cryptographically signed by its originating node. That&#x27;s a lot of ECC256 signatures and verifications. (4) Mobile-unfriendly, since mobile devices really want to be able to enter long-term hibernation and not have to wake to help others propagate their multicasts. Mobile might even want to turn off most multicast, only allowing ARP and NDP or even emulating these for no multicast at all. (Currently working on iOS and Android ZT1 ports.) This also applies to tiny low power embedded devices, and I&#x27;ve had some interest from Internet-of-things experimenters. There&#x27;s no write-up on the new algorithm yet, but it&#x27;s basically sender-side replication with lazy but deterministic gathering. It gathers recipients up to the limit from supernodes and from peers. (In reality supernodes are peers-- they&#x27;re merely peers designated as such.) I remember initially passing on that idea since I was afraid it would be too heavy on the sender, but observing real traffic flows shows that in aggregate the multicast traffic load ends up close to the same. Sender-side replication is also inherently fair -- sender pays the price -- so you don&#x27;t need such heavy signature&#x2F;verification checks to ensure that somebody can&#x27;t flood the network. This way it&#x27;s no easier to flood with multicast than with unicast. (Obviously anyone can DDOS but that&#x27;s another matter.) In the longer term I plan to add some support for merging of multicasts going to the same local network or site, but I&#x27;m not sure how yet... it&#x27;s probably going to intersect with R&amp;D work I&#x27;m doing right now on enterprise supernode federation for SDN applications and similar stuff.",

Then you get into the exciting world of bytecode manipulation, which is necessary for some mocking libraries. And, most annoyingly, it&#x27;s basically impossible to mock static methods. I&#x27;ve worked in projects that used extensive Java mocking and on a project that used Go with hand-rolled mocks. I experienced far less pain with Go, because everything was plain and simple. All we needed was to verify behaviour and we did that with relative ease. I&#x27;d note that the only 3rd-party libraries we used were Ginkgo&#x2F;Gomega, to support a more spec-style of testing.",

    "text": "Hi MichaelGG, I am a Program Manager for Azure Search and as curiousDog mentioned, yes along with DocumentDB, we also announced Azure Search which is a PaaS based full text search service. We actually leverage ElasticSearch at the core of this service and as chippy says about spatial search, we do have the ability to provide a pretty solid geo-spatial search capability thanks to Elastic Search and Lucene. To nemothekids&#x27;s point, is it very unlikely that we will offer this as a local (non-hosted) version because we found that although ElasticSearch is awesome, one of the common complaints many admin&#x27;s have is the complexity around managing systems such as ElasticSearch&#x2F;SOLR&#x2F;Lucene at high scale and how difficult it is to implement more advanced search capabilities such as tuning and relevancy. Those are areas we think we can add a lot of value being a fully managed service. Longer term, we think this will also allow us to bring even more value on top of search by adding in other Microsoft technologies. For example, we could tie in Bing Maps to allow you to easily tie in reverse geo-coding right into your search. Or perhaps allow you to leverage Bing&#x27;s synonym list so that you could allow people to search yet find results that are synonyms to commonly searched words (i.e., user types in shoes, but in your content it is referred to as footwear). Multi-language support is actually one of the big things we want to tackle in the short term and we believe that the NLP from Office will really help jump start us with this. Liam",

    "text": "It depends on how you plan your future. I&#x27;ve used quite a few text editors over the years (Bluefish, Scite, Homesite, Phase5, Idle, TextMate, Vim, others). I switched to Emacs more than a year ago with one clear goal: Not having to switch anymore. You see, most of the editors above (except vim) used to be good and then were deprecated, sold, stopped, and so on. Which of those has been existing for more than 20 years and is still able to hold up to new editors. Sadly, none (One could argue for TextMate 2, but in between there were many, many years of staleness). I was fed up with having to switch to a newfangled editor every so many years, having to identify new plugins, having to learn new keybindings. I&#x27;ve used Vim for 7 years (I think) and it came pretty close, but in the end the archaic VimScript language and the lack of async commands was something that was nagging me. I wanted to call an editor home, and hone my skills until I pass away, increasing my arcane knowledge over 10-20 years, learning ever more about the scripting language, commands, and writing more and more specific plugins that help with my tasks. I still want to be coding in 10 years, but I don&#x27;t want to switch text editors ever again. Emacs shall be my final editor [1], and that&#x27;s why I decided to switch. Because I can see Emacs still going strong in another 20 years. I wouldn&#x27;t want to say that about Sublime, or really any other editor right now. [1] There&#x27;s a case to be made that NeoVim is going to be great, and it may well be, but right now I&#x27;m really, really, really happy with Emacs + Evil. Nothing is perfect, of course, but the things that bug me are really, really small things that I could probably even fix, if I&#x27;d invest enough time; but they don&#x27;t bug me enough for that.",

We sometimes watch your scotch friday meetings, and Jack comes to our neck of the woods for a &quot;scotch tuesday&#x2F;wednesday&quot; every so often. In more relevant news, the CEO (Jonathan Bush) just wrote a book (&quot;wrote&quot;, he joked) that&#x27;s a semi-right-wing take on the problem posed in this article (lack of EHR interoperability). Solid read though regardless of politics. Also, the MDP program (the API you&#x27;re referring to) is more designed to allow third party developers to build functionality onto athenanet that we don&#x27;t have the specialization or capacity to build. It&#x27;s not really a means of sharing health data (to my knowledge). However! We have been making the sharing of EHR data a priority, or at least seeming to, with the formation of the CommonWell Health Alliance (members including most major EHR creators... except Epic, because they&#x27;re Epic). Additionally, we&#x27;re working on some stuff with athenaCommunicator to help hospitals talk to labs, and stuff with Coordinator that I think involves the Austin crew too... but I don&#x27;t know what of Coordinator we&#x27;re allowed to talk about yet so I&#x27;ll probably shut up on that matter.",

Just make sure you aren&#x27;t tying any identity you care about to dangerous transactions. That&#x27;s the only (and of course difficult) trick. If a drug buyer in a BTC transaction got the coins anonymously (say, sent a self-destructing robot to drop off cash in exchange for BTC), then that part is fine. They can go use those coins anonymously. If they ship drugs to their house, well... that alone sort of undoes it all. The drug sellers that were caught from Silk Road were caught due to things like making a huge amount of trips to post offices, getting the attention of postal workers. That may be a parallel construction, but it seems legitimate enough. Buy drugs from large seller, look at the postmarks for patterns. Then go gumshoeing around and wait &#x27;til you see the same car or people going to the same post offices over and over and over.

Additionally, it seems the site does show up in Google search results on the 10th page ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encrypted.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=photo%20quilts#h... ). I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t understand what exactly that means, but it seems to have happened at around the same timeframe that you&#x27;re referring to (5 or 6 months ago), so I&#x27;m going to bet it&#x27;s a factor. Hope you figure it out - the whole search engine algorithm thing is really complex. But, honestly, I don&#x27;t believe that Google just stopped working for a single domain. The more likely scenario is that something you&#x2F;your sister is unaware of changed and had a large negative result.",

If you check the backlinks using any number of checkers (Open Site Explorer, Ahrefs, Majestic SEO) you can find a number of over-optimized &#x27;unnatural&#x27; backlinks residing on spammy link-exchange pages in clear violation of Google&#x27;s guidelines. The only reason to place links on these pages would be to try to rise higher in Google&#x27;s search results. Yes, it feels unfair when Google drops you in search results, and Google has changed the rules over the years and it&#x27;s hard to keep up with shifting guidelines. In truth, the website can recover from this. The same people who placed spammy links on 3rd party sites in order to manipulate rankings are probably savvy enough to mount a clean up effort to get those links removed and&#x2F;or file a disavow request with Google (which basically tells them to ignore those links) Ironically, Eric Schmidt once tried to scrub Google of unfavorable search results about himself, and he was told they do not do that for individual results. ;)",

Looks to me like it was hit by Google&#x27;s Penguin 2.0 update [1] that targeted sites that had low quality links pointing in to their domain (in particular inner pages). Probably not the sisters fault, but the site has done a lot of reciprocal linking in the past which Google really frowns upon nowadays. There&#x27;s prominent page on her site featuring some of those links: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portraitquilts.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;links She also has some links from pages that are selling or exchange links to spam&#x2F;escort sites: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwr.com&#x2F;gifts&#x2F;crafts.html http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livebusinessradio.com&#x2F;trade&#x2F;recip.cgi Again, probably not her fault.

If you are going to try to figure out which links caused a problem, you&#x27;ll want to use ahrefs and majesticseo to compile a list of your backlinks, then either start sorting through them manually or use something like LinkResearchTools as a starting point. Keep in mind that removing links will probably not return your previous rankings, since the links that once caused you to rank well may now be the ones causing the problem. Removing them may restore your ability to rank well again. Also, not every ranking drop means that you were penalized. If you know you had built lots of spammy links, and your traffic dropped off at the same time Penguin was updated, then it is more likely a Penguin problem. Otherwise, there are hundreds of reasons that would need to be examined. If you are not sure, consider hiring a reputable SEO consultant to help. It won&#x27;t be cheap. Cheap is probably what got you in trouble in the first place.",

I&#x27;ll stipulate up front that I&#x27;ve never worked as a government employee, and despite doing some assessment work (like being hired to break into the Department of the Interior without their knowledge, or breaking hardware&#x2F;software that was being deployed in far away places) everywhere I&#x27;ve worked has tried very hard to steer clear of government work (not for any ethical reasons, it just pays much worse than equivalent commercial work, and is almost always boring). In fact, the last two places I worked had distinct government and commercial divisions (where I ran the commercial divisions). That said, I&#x27;ve built and run several security consulting practices in the DC area, and consequently have done hiring interviews for dozens of people who were NSA employees (1 of which we ended up hiring). Absolutely none of them have even the slightest apprehension about the nature of the work they were doing (so much as they were able to comment about it during interviews). In fact, prior to the Snowden leaks, the NSA was pretty much at the bottom of my list for government agencies doing shit I disliked. They have a pretty clear scope and charter (which we&#x27;ve come to learn has been muddied). But no one I&#x27;ve talked to, either who works there or works at a contractor in the DIB, thinks they&#x27;ve done anything wrong. Did you read those batshit NSA talking points that came out yesterday from Al Jazeera&#x27;s FOIA request? They believe those things. They think they&#x27;re doing important, valuable work to protect the country. I can only imagine that internally within NSA there has been dissent about some of the stuff that&#x27;s come out. Maybe people have resigned over it, maybe they&#x27;ve sent strongly-worded emails to their bosses. I really hope there was a great deal of dissent about the &quot;intentionally fuck up crypto standards that we push to other branches of the government&quot;, but I doubt we&#x27;ll ever hear much about it. Your questions could just as easily refer to people who work on SEO spam, or targeted advertisements (I&#x27;m not saying those things are equivalent, but they&#x27;re also jobs I&#x27;ve heard people on here posturing morally about).",

    "text": "Ok, this guy is using a couple of methods off BlackHatWorld (Probably the biggest SEO forum around if you haven&#x27;t heard of it) So essentially this guy is building this site, ranking it in Google using the churn &#x27;n Burn method, then once its ranking well he&#x27;ll contact local business saying he can link to them in return for a fee. Even though the domain is 6 months old, if you look at ahrefs this guy has 33k backlinks to the homepage. Google had a major SEO update on October 4th which essentially fucked up their algorithm more than it already was. This churn &#x27;n burn method means that you spam out a zillion backlinks and you will rank really well until the next Google update comes along (which is around 3-4 months) You could do this in the previous Google update (Penguin 2.1) and I thought Google would fix this but they just made it easier. This is a good example of the method: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackhatworld.com&#x2F;blackhat-seo&#x2F;black-hat-seo&#x2F;5769... (This was the one of the guys that essentially figured out this method from what I can tell) So with this new Google update, they are getting rid of some of the spammy sites, but more spam sites just taken their places in the rankings. Now they are focusing on the amount of content on your site rather than the backlinks. So now 10 year old sites with hundreds of legitimate, high authority backlinks are getting outranked but spammy sites with 14 backlinks and 300 gibberish articles. I&#x27;ve also been reading that with local Google searches, you get results from completely different countries. For example, people in the UK were reporting that they were getting results from sites in Russia, Argentina and New Zealand instead of UK results. I don&#x27;t think this happens as much in America from what I know. So I&#x27;m guessing Google is eventually going to iron out these problems, but it&#x27;s a battleground at the moment. If you do get outranked by this guy, make a video with your keywords in the title, same with a Facebook and LinkedIn page and then buy a bunch of backlinks off Fiverr. They should outrank pretty much any other website in a matter of days.",

    "text": "Hey all, this is the author of Ginkgo &amp; Gomega. I&#x27;m excited to see all this thoughtful conversation and figured I&#x27;d chime in with a response to keep the conversation going. (Apologies for the long post!) - Godoc documentation is coming soon. Godoc is great for API-style documentation but not particularly appropriate for tutorial&#x2F;structured&#x2F;narrative-style documentation. Think golang.org&#x2F;pkg vs golang.org&#x2F;doc. I wanted to write the &#x2F;doc first as I believe it to be more valuable for beginners and is often overlooked by the go community. &#x2F;pkg is coming soon (a few days) and is much easier to write. - @buro9: Golang is BDD-style in the same way that Cedar and Jasmine are BDD-style. This is not Cucumber (way too much DSL for me!) With that said, asynchronous testing support is baked right into Ginkgo and Gomega so the API-testing that you&#x27;d like would be easily expressed in Ginkgo and Gomega. - Assertions that I have fundamentally misunderstood Golang or the distinction between dynamic and static typed languages are interesting and I&#x27;d like to address some of them. BDD-style testing need not be limited to dynamically-typed language. Yes dynamically-typed languages need far more comprehensive test coverage to make up for the missing compiler. That&#x27;s why I tend to prefer statically-typed languages. To me BDD-style (vs the XUnit style) isn&#x27;t primarily about addressing these deficiencies in dynamic languages -- it&#x27;s about expressiveness . To that end, I think that BDD and Golang go hand in hand. Let me explain. BDD is exceptionally good at describing the behavior of branching code. Golang is filled with branching code that needs to be described in test. Here&#x27;s a classic example in pseudo-go: func DoSomethingAwesome(dependencyA DepA, dependencyB DepB) awesome Awesome, err error { stuffA, err := dependencyA.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } stuffB, err := dependencyB.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } .... return awesome, nil } With Ginkgo you can cover these branches expressively: Describe(&quot;Doing something Awesome&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;common happy case setup Context(&quot;When all is well&quot;, func() { It(&quot;should be awesome&quot;, ...) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyA fails&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;set dependencA up for failure It(&quot;should return a zero Awesome&quot;, func() { ... Expect(awesome).To(BeZero()) }) It(&quot;should error&quot;, func() { ... Expect(err).To(HaveOccured()) }) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyB fails&quot;, func() { &#x2F;&#x2F;etc... }) }) Compare this to the XUnit style: func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenAllIsWell() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyAFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyBFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } I prefer the former (note: that&#x27;s a subjective statement). IMO there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally more Golangish about the latter (if anything the fact that func&#x27;s that begin with Test are special is kinda weird), and since Gomega&#x27;s matchers are fluent in Go they know about things like zero values and errors having occured. Moreover, both Ginkgo and Gomega have been built to make testing asynchronous code (read: concurrent goroutines) easy and expressive. This isn&#x27;t a carbon copy of RSpec&#x2F;Cedar&#x2F;Jasmine, it&#x27;s a synthesis of the best ideas from those testing frameworks expressed in ways that cater specifically to Golang. - Concerns about using interface{} and reflection seem odd to me. First off, the Go authors provide both of these things to precisely solve the sort of problem that Gomega is trying to solve. Nobody wants to write and maintain matchers that look like: Expect(foo).To(EqualInt64(3)) Expect(bar).To(EqualString(&quot;blarp&quot;)) Expect(baz).To(EqualMyCustomAwesomeType(awesome)) besides the reflect package&#x27;s `DeepEqual` does a great job comparing `interface{}` to `interface{}` correctly. Most importantly of all: we&#x27;re all using interface{} all the time: `fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d %f %s %v&quot;, ...)`! And thanks for seeing the point @karma_fountain: Gomega&#x27;s matchers have excellent reporting about what precisely went wrong when a matcher fails. Bare assertions lack this and a look through the Go tests shows a lot of reinventing-the-wheel to provide what probably amounts to inconsistent error output to the developer. Why not put that all in one place, call it a matcher library, and make it dead easy to write custom matchers? - And @shoo: yes, thanks for pointing it out: the example is somewhat fabricated and isn&#x27;t a compelling argument for BDD vs XUnit. It&#x27;s hard to cook up a good BDD example in very short space!",

    "text": "(context: i&#x27;ve been working mainly with python, and have almost no experience with go) My initial reaction to the example was that it looked like something that could be easily unit-tested, without the added layer of BDD over the top. But that&#x27;s probably just a symptom of the example appearing as something that would be simple to build and test. E.g. in python i&#x27;d translate `Expect(scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;]).To(Equal(1))` to `assert scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;] == 1` which is essentially the same, but only uses one bit of machinery (assert) rather than three. That said, the more ways to test things the merrier. I think if you are interested in testing larger chunks of functionality &#x2F; user-facing bits of behaviour rather than invariants of the building blocks of your program, then perhaps BDD starts to look more appealing, so the two approaches seems complementary. Having an expressive static type system is again complementary, as that prevents you from making many trivial errors, and you just have to test for the remaining ones that the type system cannot express. (i miss that in python) after a little dig through the code, it looks like &quot;EXPECT foo TO EQUAL barr&quot; translates as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;gomega.go#L15 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L27 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L48 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers.go#L7 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers&#x2F;equal_ma... so there&#x27;s lots of `interface{}`s and reflection and so on",

I guess if you think mailing hundreds of packages of medicines via the postal service is &quot;anonymous&quot; then maybe they&#x27;re right. The real message is: Don&#x27;t be careless. Don&#x27;t create huge patterns we can detect via physical surveillance. At least, so far. Maybe it&#x27;ll come out that all these cases were the result of parallel construction and they really found everyone by defeating Tor. But so far the complaints seem pretty straightforward.",

    "text": "Long distance is tempting, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily a good idea. All kinds of wireless interference&#x2F;collision will make available bandwidth really low. For example, on 2.4 GHz 802.11 protocols, there are 11 channels from 1 to 11. All wireless routers operating in US have to be on one of the 11 channels. When there are other wireless APs within the range, you and others share the channel. There&#x27;s a limitation on how much bandwidth a channel can give in total. That&#x27;s the hard limitation, given that CSMA&#x2F;CA works well. That&#x27;s why channel 3 and channel 8 often work great (most wireless routers have default channel choice 1, 6, or 11) - they are far away from defaults that others are using. Same thing applies to 5 GHz 802.11 networks. Now back to this project. 1 km is really long distance. You get communication range as large as a circle with radius being 1 km. There are a lot of wireless devices that fall in this range. You might not get affected by them since they don&#x27;t have that powerful antennas, but your signals will effectively lower the bandwidth of all routers in the area.",

In social-graph-optimisation the overt act is much higher granularity - its to follow &#x2F; friend another person. So the game is to join as many graphs as possible, or to find the graph of the person you want, and join that. I think this granularity problem will severely limit the acceptance of SEO-for-social-graphs. Seo right now works because it is possible to finesse at the right granularity level as a function of a users action. Geo-location work will also massively help - but social is effectively painting ads onto my friends T-Shirts in the hope I will read them. I struggle to see the next fine grained action (*) We need a better term than social media, because this is all just variations on an individual has their own webspace, and updates that space regularly, plus a central scraping service to let others know.

    "text": "Well, it's actually a bit more complicated than that. The bug is definitely something we wanted to know about, and we're thankful for the report. That said, there are some constraints that we put in place for the reward program to protect researchers from harm. For example, we don't want physical security or the police second-guessing the intent of someone trying to sneak into one of our buildings - so we set a very clear scope for the program, pragmatically focusing on our user-facing applications and excluding things such as attacks on our facilities and corporate infrastructure. It's a broad exclusion, but it's hard to come up with something finer-grained yet clear enough. In the same vein, we ask researches that they don't go after any systems unless it's perfectly clear that the application is owned and operated by us - for example, because it's in an IP range registered to us. Again, while this may be more limiting than we'd like, it protects the community against overly litigious parties if the system proves to belong to somebody else. In several unusually serious cases, we have made case-by-case exceptions and have paid external researchers for nominally non-qualifying bugs; but it's a tricky balance, and we use this power very cautiously.

    "text": "It seems to me that modern web dev happens mostly in JavaScript. The driving reason for this is so apps can be wrapped to be like native apps, and have a level of state and data persistence. The trend in modern web apps is to send a lot of data down as JSON, and only do serverside rendering in cases where you need SEO or incredible rendering speed. You make a choice between angular, ember, bootstrap+handlebars, roll your own, or a few others. On the back-end, there is a similar array of very reasonable non-real-time frameworks, mostly centered around Python (Django, Flask, etc.), Ruby on Rails, or the newish and sexy and real-timish node.js. Go is apparently pretty popular on HN, and imagine it's not the same academic trap that Haskell is, but I've never touched the stuff. I find Google programming tools to be very good usually (AppEngine, Angular, Chrome dev tools). Your data store that underlies all of this depends heavily on your application. You can still get plenty of mileage out of MySQL, or Postgres for geo apps, but there is a large community building on top of NoSQL type data stores too. These are my impressions from having done web dev 4-5 years ago, then focusing mostly on mobile, then having some web projects under my management again recently. The shift to JavaScript became apparent to me when our engineers looked at and chose technologies. I personally was doing a lot of client-rendered Javascript (\"web app style\") 5 years ago for TrailBehind.com, and it seems like the whole world works that way now, just more high-tech with HTML compilers and templating and more.",

These guys didn't start a technology company in the sense that they needed technology innovation to succeed. They started an innovative cleaning business that uses some technology. They were building software in well trodden territory with a clear scope and execution path. If you want to revolutionize web search, or be the first company to create an eCommerce store, or run a PaaS hosting business, then you probably have a tech company. If you're starting one of these, you damn well better have a nerd or two around. :)",

Read it back to yourself: &#62; Search Engine Optimization They're already liars. They aren't optimizing anybody's search engine. They're optimizing HTML so that it can be easily parsed and crawled, but that doesn't sound as sexy. It's marketing hocus pocus, tantamount to chart reading for day traders in the stock market. Just like chart readers, gazing into the Rorschach blots of spikes and trends in the stock market, they don't truly understand, and can't honestly answer to, how their composite numbers tie back to reality. They honestly have no control over the search engines they claim to optimize for, and have only an outsider's probed understanding of the internal workings of the search engines they target. The exception to this is when former employees of search engines are hired as consultants at these places that claim to offer these services, but honestly aside from that sort of intra-industry incest, what else do they have to offer? SEO as a term is a throwback to the late 90's when a lot of people didn't really understand what search engines do, and got sold on a trend. Yes, yes, robots.txt. Yes, unobtrusive JavaScript. Yes, structure your DOM in a well-organized, logical manner. Yes, simplify unauthenticated link URLs, and try to correlate references semantically. Yes, use the alt, title and name attributes, to further orient semantics. I get it, okay. Y'know, these same ideas overlap well-enough with accessibility standards. Anything beyond this kind of coding practice is really either link spam, or simple tasks like requesting that a search engine crawl your domain. And that's a marketing campaign. Nothing is being optimized. Can I stop putting this archaic buzzword on my resume? I don't optimize search engines, and unless you're posting an ad for a position at one, neither do you.

I'm still not sure how the new software will ease the problems that forums face. i) Web searching a problem returns a hit for a forum. I visit the forum, to see someone asking my question, and someone else saying \"Search the web, noob\". ii) People just love feeding trolls. It's trivially easy for trolls to disrupt forums. iii) Vested_Contributors - forums have rules. New users get punished for not following the rules; long term users have people making excuses for them (\"It's Bob! Everyone knows Bob! And he makes great posts normally, so let him off this time!\"). iv) Signal : Noise - and this is made worse by having limited number of posts per page.

    "text": "I personally think that Microsoft is far too willing to roll over and play dead when it comes to anti-trust issues. They should simply ban any adware on Windows that is opt-out rather than opt-in. If anyone breaks that rule, they should put it in the anti-virus signature database for Microsoft Security Essentials, so it cannot be installed without the user going through hoops. They should then go to the DOJ or the EU, say, \"We want to clean up the user experience,\" back it up with articles from Mac-lovers like Walt Mossberg talking about how bad the crapware experience is on Windows, printouts of forums like this one showing nearly-universal hatred of these practices, etc. And if the DOJ or EU say \"No, we'll slap antitrust fines on you if you do that,\" then they should publish all of the correspondence publicly, and harness the waves of Internet fury to compel the regulators to back down. Even if the regulators don't back down, they'll get good publicity from actually taking responsibility for their platform and trying to clean it up. P.S. The Bing toolbar doesn't help Microsoft's case. They should \"take one for the user\" and voluntarily eliminate the Bing toolbar. If they succeed in getting rid of all toolbars, then maybe they'll actually get more traffic to Bing, because users won't have their search engines hijacked.",

I envisioned something which would monitor the %appdata% path where any user-specific data goes, as well as maybe the registry. Any changes get synced back to my shiny new Ninite account to be incorporated into the next install. Clearly this would take a bit of work, but since you're already imposing a selection process on your apps, and a majority of them are already well-behaved in terms of how they manage their data, it doesn't seem impractical. Ninite is generally the first thing that I run on a new Windows install. Pulling in my data feels like a natural part of this, and if you could get some kind of reasonable implementation worked out -- a background service syncing %appdata% regularly, a simple merge model which simply picks a winner instead of trying to reconcile the changes, etc, at first blush it seems quite workable.",

I clicked the one that seemed most promising and somehow ended with a new Zip-Archiver installed ... So I went back and found the Partition Magic installer. It was an installer with 'added value' that asked me three times to install some toolbar crap. I ended up with one of those toolbars installed because unchecking the box and clicking on 'next' obviously is not enough. You have to click the decline button instead of next.

We can see the origins of this becoming a problem on Ubuntu with Canonical adding stuff like the Amazon search and seemingly having no issue with bundleware as a means of monetisation. On the other hand I'm surprised this isn't more of an issue on the Mac, since Mac (especially older versions) will allow installation of software from random sources which could include bundleware. Is there something about OS X that makes bundleware more difficult to develop or is it just easier to monetise an OS X app without bundleware?",

One developer starts with an advert, somebody else has two, a third developer gets paid to sneak in some toolbar, the first notices \"hey, I can make money that way, too\", and the ball gets rolling. Now, the question is why this has not happened for Mac Software, at least not on that scale. Gruber (2004) claims it is due to zero tolerance ( http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows ). I think that is partly true, and it sort-of started with the original PC. Installing a DOS program such as Lotus123 was a nightmare, where people had to answer such question as \"number of lines on a page\" and \"how does your printer do bold\" to configure a printer. Installing hardware, similarly, was a nightmare (what IRQ should we use? Do you have extended or expanded memory? etc).",

The default settings of the very latest OS won't allow a novice user to run a crapware installer, and Apple's app store won't feature them (unless the harried reviewer glances away from his monitor to drink some water or something). HOWEVER, Mac OS X has never had this problem, and before the app store there was nothing inherently harder about writing crapware that bundles whatever creepy garbage could be monetized. So actually I really wonder why OS X and Linux never had this problem (to any major extent). Is it merely the awesomeness of single-digit market share? In that case, Ubuntu's safe but Apple better start worrying about it. Personally I suspect it's more complicated than that, but my ideas are half-baked.",

I presume that people using Macs tend to be 1) wary of downloading any programs from random websites and 2) wary of having to run something like an installer. The Mac App Store means that people will only do these things less going forward.",

    "text": "I'll take this chance to recommend the following linux distributions to those non-sysadmins who are wondering which one they can try out: - Fedora 17 with Gnome. Out of the box it offers all kinds of installation options, like the one I always wanted and only found in Fedora (in my words): \"Use all this but only this free space, and also encrypt it\". The only downside is that out of the box it lacks some things every desktop user will want, like media codecs, but can be installed very easily. There are also tons of addons for Gnome that you will want to improve the UI (eg: get back the minimize button -.-), you can get them at extensions.gnome.org. - Ubuntu 12.04 server edition. I chose server edition because it has an option for disk encryption, but it will use the entire disk, which sucks unless you have two disks like I do. Then you install 'ubuntu-desktop' and you are done. There is also a problem with both server and desktop edition when installing into some HDD's, they fail to align correctly for different block sizes. Other than that, this is the perfect distro for me. It is LTS so it will be supported for 5 years, and I hope that by that time they have rolled back the crap that they added to 12.10. - Fedora 18. It should be released today, let's see what they got.",

They lie about download numbers, about download size, about number of software actually installed and about their connexions. They even lie on the actual payback price. If you refuse, they build special websites, copying yours, with your IP and trademark and register adwords with your name, in every way possible. They also resell their solutions/websites to other people, using \"Affiliate networks\", so that once you take one down, 20 appear. And the guy who you took down had no idea who you were or what the software was... They also have deals with download.com/softopedia/softonic to change/rewrap your installer, without your agreement, often violating your license; or they give back money to those websites, so they are ranked higher than normal other downloads. And of course, open source software are never respected. I believe OP is very polite: There are no good reasons to not shame them publicly.",

When I was reading the original TC article, I was thinking that there is actually an incredible opportunity here to create a legitimate ad network that would allow desktop developers to monetize similarly to how it's done on the web - to basically become the DoubleClick of the desktop world. Why should ad supported desktop apps be any different than ad supported mobile or web apps? Edit: These downvotes are pretty surprising, I didn't realize I was even being controversial. Can someone explain why creating a legitimate, privacy-respecting ad platform which allows desktop developers to monetize their applications in a manner that's almost exactly the same as ad supported web and mobile apps is that awful? I'm not even saying that's necessarily what they're up to, I can just see where there's a tremendous opportunity to try and clean up the industry, and how, based on the people involved, the author and the commenter above could very easily be jumping to the wrong conclusions.",

We recommend you to install VLC from videolan.org, etc.\" That way, casual users will at least be aware of the external installs problem.",

    "text": "To dominate a radio spectrum usualy ends up with who has the strongest transmitter. BUT in todays digital age and more refined tunning of radio's into more decimal places. Then I believe the following approach would be the best approach for less power. Pick your target spectrum range, Then using a highpower transmitter higher powered than the other as above to do a very granular spectrum hopping around the spectrum but at least transmitting on every channel within that spectrum at a period of frequency that would be greater than normal error corrected interferance by that your signal would then cover the spectrum range alocated but instead of having to do a wide band of the entire spectrum you are picking channels (by channels I mean frequency range that is not interfeared with by either side as you can have a transmission on wifi say that is on channel 3 and can be picked up faintly if your on channel 1, bad example but you should follow what I'm meaning by channel in this case of a spectrum block) at a time interval that would exceed error correction and as such rendering others use of the channel extreemly hard and with that all channels in the defined frequency range, aka spectrum. Now by doing that you would need the least amount of power to block others use of that spectrum and at the same time have a very wide albeit spectrum hopping chunk of bandwith to use and abuse and the faster you make the spectrum hopping to break error handerling of others trying to use that range. Of course with that approach you would have details to work on like frequency channels and how granular you defined those and also the level of error correction you wish to defeat. Remember if you want to compete with others digital transmissions then this is great BUT with analogue it may very well be a case that somebody talking would still be understandable with the level of interfearance. A look at signal type and how it would be analoguely(sic) interpreted is one aspect that may effect how you encode your data as you may end up disrupting the receaving speaker enough to impeede the other signals sound transmision. There is also the aspect of how long you stay on a channel at certain frequencies with some needing longer than others to transmit something usable and the fun of recieving the signal out of step as different frequencies propergate(travel) at different rates(speed) so that would cause out of step reception, though easily countered if your aware of that design aspect. NOW there is a far far easier way and sadly I don't think it is what I would calla hacker approach and is more the script-kiddie solution. That would be to send a silly large pulse on the frequency so strong that it blows all the transmitters. Now you would need to inform your chaps ahead so they could switch of and fold there areils in half type of thing ahead of your radio nuke or more a radio DOS attack. Then they could setup ready afterwards and you would of blown all other recievers and with that the only people who can listern are those you want to listern. Not elegant, but certainly a partial solution that would be cheap to implement as it is that crude, hence not what I call a pure hacker solution. I also suspect the amount of power to do this would exceed the prize money being offered, so you would be pushed and indeed insane to build and test such an approach.",

The core purpose of SEO is to do exactly what you said here: \"The whole premise of the open web is that natural selection would allow rich information to be filtered through because it is good.\" It's called Search Engine OPTIMIZATION for a reason. The goal is to build very well structured sites by following specific sets of best practices. Sure, there are lots of spammers out there.

    "text": "1. Are you confusing SEO for visibility? SEO == Search Engine Optimization. Google, Bing, and Yahoo didn't even crack 0.5% of your referral sites. If you're not getting traffic from search engines then you're not optimized and ranking for stuff when someone searches. That has nothing to do with the technical stuff like tags and more to do with the actual content. Looking at the data you provide, Hacker News accounts for almost 1/2 your visits, 1/4 on Twitter, then everything else. (BTW, you don't have % of NEW visits in your post which is a more interesting number to read.) The half life of content on Twitter is 3 hours ( http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/ ) which means you're only really visible for, at best, 1 day. Promotion on Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are great but, if I were a writer, I would want to see long-term visibility to new readers where I'm NOT promoting yourself. ... Like Google searches. Assume people are looking to compare Techstars with something else. The #1 search, according to Google Instant search, for \"techstars vs (something)\" is \"techstars vs y combinator\" If your post \"Given The Opportunity: Should You Do TechStars or YC\" showed up on the first page of Google then I would say you've been able to achieve great visibility without SEO. ..... But you don't even show up in the first 5 pages. So, I think you've confused Search Engine Optimization with visibility. (common mistake, actually) ------------ Let's look at your data.... You didn't analyse or provide any insight, which is what I think people should DO with data. (Full disclosure: I'm work in the analytics department for my company. I research and write code to answer these kinds of questions for clients) 2. Are people actually reading your blog? It says currently that the average pages per visit is about 2 and they're spending 0:52 seconds on your blog. The average adult reads 250-300 words every minute. ( http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy ) At a glance you average 150-200 word posts. Does that mean they're only reading half of the second page they go to (What is the time on page for second page?) What is the second page? Is it the home page or another blog post? The data you provide doesn't help to answer that. You didn't mention your \"% of Exits\". A bounce rate, by definition, is always visits that only visited one page and left. Therefore, \"% of Bounce rate\" isn't a good metric to look at for you because your average pages per visit is over 1. \"% of Exits\" sorted by the URL of the page would give you insight into your readers. If your \"% of Exits\" on your home page is really high, then it may mean your readers aren't finding anything interesting to read. Conversely, if the \"% of Exits\" is usually a blog post, that's OK, especially if it's their second page, it means they may have read two posts then left. ------------ 3. Are you gaining new readers / are old readers coming back? You said that the percentage of new visits is 70%. Over the past year is that increasing, decreasing, or going all over the place? What about \"% of returning visits?\" If you're trying to go after new readers, great job. I would think making sure they return for more later is also important. I don't think you really want to be a one hit wonder. ------------ 4. Are your readers subscribing to your mailing list? It's on the right side of every page, so I'm guessing you want to make sure people notice it. Nobody wants spam, so if they subscribe you're almost guaranteed they like what you're writing. Are visitors subscribing to your mailing list? Is that number increasing? It's a good thing if they are.",

    "text": "It seems that to do shenanigans with Bitcoin would require the same care to avoid information leakage that would be required to do similar things with global digital payment networks and banks. The key would be to begin by considering any address linked to an identity that is you or related to you \"dirty,\" and to be careful about avoiding linkage to any of those dirty addresses. To really be careful I think you'd have to delve into graph theory and data mining a bit yourself, or follow the precautions of someone who knows what they're talking about. You'd also have to take care to pay attention to network addresses under the protocol, using Tor or similar proxying systems and considering any address that's been used from an IP that can be linked to you similarly \"dirty.\" Use of VPSes that accept anonymous payment would also be an option, though again... don't SSH to them from your house! Use Tor or smurf the data around by way of proxies and drop sites and such. Laundering money would require extreme caution to avoid such contamination, and would present many of the same challenges as money laundering in the fiat currency world. BTC/fiat conversions would be very risky. In-person BTC/fiat conversions are vulnerable to old fashioned gumshoe police work: \"hey, that BTC you exchanged on localbitcoin... you happen to remember what that guy looked like?\" These are also only feasible for small quantities. Large quantities would present a huge challenge. What this really means is that Bitcoin is not intrinsically an instrument for villainy as some lazy press articles make it out to be. In fact, criminal use of Bitcoin requires orders of magnitude more technical sophistication, which the vast majority of criminals do not have. A highly educated or sophisticated criminal or intelligence network could surely pull off shenanigans with Bitcoin, but I doubt your average thug or child porn wanker is going to even comprehend the stuff I wrote above. So at the very least, Bitcoin is only a criminal tool for very geeky high-IQ criminals.",

    "text": "I think perhaps Patrick didn't intentionally name it A/Bingo for the SEO, but he did understand the value OSS and link juice. If I thought of it, he certainly did -- but the name A/Bingo totally stands on its own as a really good name for this software in many ways. http://www.jcdrepair.com/blog/your-business-has-more-to-offe... Another example, and the one that inspired me, was one of the bloggers mentioned earlier. Patrick McKenzie runs a small, online business selling bingo cards to teachers (he sold over $45,000 worth of bingo cards in 2011). One thing Patrick does really well is search engine optimization (SEO). One of his techniques for getting people to link to his site (a big part of a high Google ranking), involves open source software. “What!?” That might be your reaction right now. What does open source software have to do with bingo cards for 1st graders? The answer is nothing. However, Patrick is a software developer that wrote the code for his bingo card website. He recognized that some of the code he wrote was valuable all on its own. So he turned part of it into an open source Ruby on Rails project, put the code up on his site along with instructions on using it, and then told the world about it. What happened? All sorts of software developers, with no interest in bingo cards but a huge interest in his software, started linking to the portion of Patrick’s website that hosted this open source project. More links to his website meant a better ranking on Google which meant more sales of his bingo card creator. So while he didn’t directly sell his offering the way Amazon sold their’s, he did use it in a way that created more business for him.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure that this Mpemba Effect is folklore. The hot water must necessarily pass through the temperature that the cooler water starts at. In fact if we are to believe this than at some point the initially hot water and the initially cold water must, at some point, be the same (average) temperature. Why then would it start to cool faster? Options that I can think of 1) initially hot water cools very asymmetrically so some hot portion gives of heat (to the air!) faster 2) more rapid temperature change sets up strong convective currents that, because of momentum, stay around, causing the initially hot water to give up heat faster. These both seem very unlikely. Fluid water is a very good heat conductor (and air a good insulator) making it unlikely that there would be significant temperature gradients and intuition tells us that freezing water takes much longer than it takes any sort of current to die down. (also note that these two effects would act to cancel each other out) As for the reasons mentioned in the wikipedia article: 1)Definition of frozen: I suppose that this could account for the effect if you measured the time for cold water to completely freeze and hot water to reach 0 degrees C! But in general as long as you use the same metric this won't matter 2) Evaporation (reducing the volume to be frozen): So an initially hot fluid will evaporate more and I suppose result in a slightly smaller volume to freeze. Since the thermal mass is proportional volume and the heat transfer is proportional to area this is a real effect. However the % change in volume of any reasonable shape of water is so insignificant compared to the difference in energy of hot water and cold water that this effect is almost certainly negligible. (perhaps if the claim was hot water freezes faster than cold water if it is laid out in very very very thin sheets I would buy it because of this.) 3) Convection: see above. 4) Frost: Since the water must pass through the same temperature (0 C) for frost to start to build the frost must grow differently on initially hot water than initially cold. I really see no reason to believe this is the case 5)Super cooling: again, if the convective forces persist for a mush longer time than seems reasonable... 6) Solutes and dissolved gases: I mean if one fluid is a different chemical composition than the other then I suppose all bets are off, but I feel the claim of \"warmer water freezes faster than colder water\" implies they are both the same substance However the main reason I believe this to be an Urban Myth is that it makes such a good story. It fits our belief as a culture that there are weird things about science that we don't understand and it challenges our initial intuition in a memorable way. In addition it requires more effort to test than most of us are willing to put forth (including me: I would be very interested if someone would actually do the test recommended in the wikipedia article.) Lastly; hot water freezing faster is a much better story than the other way around. Telling people that hot water freezes faster makes you seem to have some kind of secret knowledge; a spell you can cast over ice cube trays to make them into ice faster. I bet a reasonable rule for judging truth is that, all else being equal, the better story is less likely to be the true one, because if the truth was also the better story then no one would tell the boring one.",

    "text": "No doubt, there are plenty of cases when medication is the right option. However, there are many more cases where it's not. How we do psychology? We take a bunch of symptoms that seem to coincide with a group of individuals and we label it as a disorder : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd#DSM-IV_criteria The fact that these symptoms exist and cause problems for many individuals is of no question - that's why we have a \"disorder\" label associated with it. There is no dispute that medication is effective in treating these symptoms, either. However, the claim that medication \"even more effective\" is flimsy, if not flat out wrong. The problem is that there are many more studies devoted to the \"effects of ritalin on ADHD\" than there are to the \"effects of exercise and ADHD.\" Or meditation, or biofeedback, or eating 7 lbs of celery a day, or whatever. To make the claim that \"drugs are more effective\" is easier because studies of this nature are more prevalent - but it doesn't make it right. That would be a total confirmation bias. A difficulty in comparing medication to other methods is that medication = instant gratification and instant results. You eat a pill. A half hour later, you are focused, less scattered and more attentive. In the similar way to how coffee wakes you up if you are tired. It's easy to make an experiment out of such results. Exercise, in contrast, isn't instant. Exercise increases levels of nor-epinephrine and dopamine... but not nearly as rapidly (or with as little work) as an amphetamine compound. Steady and healthy levels of serotonin (which is now being studied as another player in the ADHD game) don't begin to rise until weeks of daily exercising. It may be slower, but our bodies are capable of changing, and for quantities of any given chemical being pumped out to increase, you need to keep doing things that keep causing it to be released. You need to form habits that make your body more effective at producing it's own chemical cocktails. Take a basic course in human physiology or neuroscience if you don't believe how amazing and capable our bodies and brains are at adapting and improving. Furthermore, a disorder label can easily be misconstrued by a young individual with ADHD. They might think to themselves, \"Wow, finally, a word to describe all the problems I'm having. It's not my fault after all, I'm sick, and I need medicine.\" It sucks because instead of really trying to go beyond the condition by using their will, they may give up and go the route of altering their minds externally - just to keep up with their peers. Is that a bad thing? Well, I'll leave that up to the reader. It is my personal opinion that that overcoming challenges of ADHD is not only possible through other, healthier methods (exercise, meditation and learning/coping strategies), but is more rewarding as well (speaking from personal experience). However, no one can do this by themselves - and it sucks that some people do not have the support, and that schools don't have a 15 minute exercise break every 3 hours, and that they don't let you eat snacks in class, and that we are constantly exposed to electronic stimulation from a very young age, that some of us don't learn how to control our intake of these things. Television, video games and other forms of electronic stimulation have been proven to release dopamine (Jeez, what doesn't?). A person with ADHD can easily focus to a show on TV with quickly changing camera angles, loud sounds, constant dialogue and continuous novelty. We grew up with this. But, when we are in class, we fidget, and daydream and blurt things out because this stimulation is not present, so our bodies are attempting to mitigate the dopamine withdrawal through the constant production of activity, of both the mind and the body. Finally, Ritalin hasn't been studied for 70 years. It's been about 40. It didn't start being used for ADHD until The late 60s, and wasn't in widespread use until the 90s - which is when the more serious studies began to come out. There's much more to say, but I'm getting tired :) Sources: http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-03-26-adhd-treatmen... http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041220013546.ht... http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565830",

However the real barrier to this stuff being really useful is the frequency and granularity of updates. The thing that geo-location brings, the thing that we really want is serendipity. It massively increases the chance of meeting a friend while out because your devices know you are a block (or a foot) away even if you don't. This means that our ability to encounter serendipity is exponentially increased because it's no longer limited by our senses or memories. Dodgeball would introduce friends of friends, for example. The problem remains, until geo-location is automatic and effortless the cost and frequency of updates belies the effort.",

    "text": "Most of the criticism (I think) revolves around the methodology being biased towards unambitious projects. The economists were asked to rank proposals according to how much good they would do in alleviating existing world problems. The premise is a limited budget roughly based on 'aid budgets'. I think climate change should have been left outside of what they were looking at altogether for lots of reasons. The projects are too uncertain to be ranked. Putting an extra $1b towards existing climate change projects may result in absolutely no effect on climate change. We are talking about risky, expensive projects. An economist doesn't really know if a propaganda campaign to convince americans or Chinese to sign some deal is better then some geo-engineering technology project to directly cool the earth. It is outside the realm of what smart economists are good at. - It is coming out of different pockets. Climate change affects rich countries too. It is self interested spending. Certainly, there are tragedy of the commons like problems. But it is still in the interest of those spending to spend. - The effects of climate change are uncertain and indirect. One of the potential climate change issues is decreased glacial melt in India resulting in less summer river flows in to Pakistan. India is entitled (by treaty) to a fixed (in litres) amount of water. Pakistan needs this water to grow food without which it will be in famine. This could result in, mass refuge crisis, nuclear war, etc. It is virtually impossible to link something like that directly to an increase or decrease of $500m in spending by some NGO. *But... If you are a millionaire or in charge of an NGO or a foreign spending budget or give money to a poverty related charity, the Copenhagen Consensus seems like an important list to consider.
