    "text": "I run multiple content-heavy sites and got tired of one thing: there was no deterministic way to validate with the AI agent whether my content was actually optimized. Not &quot;probably fine&quot; — actually checked against concrete rules, both for traditional search and for AI search engines. SEO linters exist, but they&#x27;re either paid SaaS, not automatable, or ignore the structural patterns that LLMs use when deciding what to cite. So I built one. geo-lint is a CLI with 92 rules: 32 SEO (table stakes — titles, descriptions, headings, slugs, canonical URLs, schema, the works), 35 GEO rules specifically for AI citation readiness, 14 content quality checks inspired by Yoast, and the rest for technical and i18n validation. We extensively researched the current state of GEO and AEO to make sure the rules reflect what actually gets content cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — not outdated advice. The design principle: the linter is deterministic, the AI agent is creative. Same content in, same violations out, every time. The agent does the fixing. In practice, I install it in a project, paste one prompt into Claude Code or Cursor: Run npx geo-lint --format=json, fix every violation using the suggestion field, re-run until the output is []. And walk away. The agent reads the JSON violations, edits the files, re-lints, loops — no manual input. When it finishes, the content is validated for both traditional search ranking and AI citation. One command, both outcomes, across an entire site. Every rule outputs a machine-readable suggestion field that tells the agent exactly what to change. The JSON has no formatting, no ANSI colors — pure structured data. Works with Markdown&#x2F;MDX out of the box, extensible to Astro, HTML, or any CMS via custom adapters. This is extracted from the toolchain I use on production client content at my agency. MIT licensed, zero peer dependencies, TypeScript. Happy to answer questions about GEO patterns, what makes content citable by LLMs, or how the agentic loop works in practice.",

    "text": "Tesla claims that their cameras use &quot;photon counting&quot; and that this lets them see well in the dark, in fog, in heavy rain, and when facing bright lights like the sun. Photon counting is a real thing [1] but that&#x27;s not what Tesla claims to be doing. I cannot tell if what they are doing is something actually effective that they should have called something other than &quot;photon counting&quot; or just the usual Musk exaggerations. Anyone here familiar with the relevant fields who can say which it is? Here&#x27;s what they claim, as summarized by whatever it is Google uses for their &quot;AI Overview&quot;. &gt; Tesla photon counting is an advanced, raw-data approach to camera imaging for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), where sensors detect and count individual light particles (photons) rather than processing aggregate image intensity. By removing traditional image processing filters and directly passing raw pixel data to neural networks, Tesla improves dynamic range, enabling better vision in low light and high-contrast scenarios. It says these are the key aspects: &gt; Direct Data Processing: Instead of relying on image signal processors (ISPs) to create a human-friendly picture, Tesla feeds raw sensor data directly into the neural network, allowing the system to detect subtle light variations and near-IR (infrared) light. &gt; Improved Dynamic Range: This approach allows the system to see in the dark exceptionally well by not losing information to standard image compression or exposure adjustments. &gt; Increased Sensitivity: By operating at the single-photon level, the system achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio, effectively &quot;seeing in the dark&quot;. &gt; Elimination of Exposure Limitations: The technique helps mitigate issues like sun glare, allowing for better visibility in extreme lighting conditions. &gt; Neural Network Training: The raw, unfiltered data is used to train Tesla&#x27;s neural networks, allowing for more robust, high-fidelity perception in complex, real-world driving environments.

The pattern I see isn’t AI is revolutionary. It’s: 1) The easy wins are done. 2) The marginal gains are getting expensive. 3) The distribution layer is shifting faster than the capability layer. Most new model releases aren’t unlocking fundamentally new workflows. They’re compressing friction in workflows that already work. That’s useful, but not narrative-worthy. The real shift isn’t GPT-5.3 vs GPT-5.2. It’s: - AI replacing search as the interface layer. - AI compressing junior-level execution work. - AI reshaping how products are discovered (AI Overviews, summaries, agents). That doesn’t make MoltBook any less absurd. Burning compute on bots talking to bots is peak theater. But dismissing everything because of the theater might be like dismissing the internet because of Pets.com. We may be at peak hype, but that doesn’t mean the substrate shift isn’t real.

    "text": "I’m building an AI search optimization product and wanted to apply the same principles internally: fix content architecture before launch instead of correcting problems after users — or AI systems — struggle to understand it. To do this, I created a Python CLI tool that analyzes semantic structure using vector embeddings. It parses markdown files, generates embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI), computes cosine similarity, runs k-means clustering, detects redundancy and semantic gaps, and produces visualizations like heatmaps, dendrograms, and UMAP projections. The stack includes Python 3.12, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, UMAP, and Plotly, with embedding caching for speed. Analysis Overview: The site contains 25 pages (~12.9k words) across features, concepts, use cases, and resources. No stub pages were found. Topic coherence (measured via average similarity between sections) ranged from 0.73 to 0.93, with most pages between 0.78–0.88. Lower coherence wasn’t necessarily bad — the Proof Engine page scored lower because it intentionally covers many subtopics. Semantic redundancy showed only one pair above 0.85 similarity, both intentional cross-link sections. Earlier, I removed two index pages with 85%+ similarity to parent pages, flattening navigation from three layers to two. No semantic gaps were detected; all pages were well connected. Hub analysis confirmed that Home, Learn, and the AEO Playbook act as central nodes, matching the intended architecture of concepts → applications → tools. Heatmap clustering revealed: * Concept pages: 0.65–0.80 similarity * Feature pages: 0.45–0.65 similarity * Use cases: 0.70–0.79 similarity Embeddings were chosen over keyword analysis because they capture meaning rather than wording, detecting paraphrased overlap and relationships relevant to AI retrieval systems. Limitations include model sensitivity, arbitrary cluster counts, and coherence scores that don’t fully account for intentional structure. Planned improvements include entity coverage analysis, competitor comparisons, and query-simulation testing. The entire process took under a minute but prevented structural issues that could cause discoverability problems later. Running semantic analysis pre-launch helped validate architecture, reduce duplication, and ensure content works for both humans and AI retrieval systems.",

Wrote up the failure modes I&#x27;ve actually seen. The short version: Skill bloat is the sneaky one. You add tools over time, each makes sense individually, then at 30+ tools the agent starts picking wrong ones. Anthropic&#x27;s team wrote about this too. A single Playwright MCP server burns 11.7K tokens on tool definitions alone, included in every request whether you use them or not. Context rot caught me off guard. Chroma measured 18 LLMs and found 11&#x2F;12 drop below 50% performance at just 32K tokens. We had a bug where adding a new capability pushed an older instruction into the &quot;lost in the middle&quot; zone. Took two days to figure out why an unrelated feature degraded. The scariest one is when a prompt tweak makes your agent stop saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and start confidently making things up. Surface metrics go up. Accuracy goes down. Google&#x27;s AI Overviews had this problem at scale. Also covers cost creep (same traffic, 40% higher bill, nobody has a cost gate in CI&#x2F;CD), multi-agent cascade failures (Berkeley&#x27;s MAST paper found 14 failure modes across 7 frameworks, ChatDev hit 33% correctness), and model updates breaking things you didn&#x27;t touch.

    "text": "Being able to sing on pitch is more music training than voice training. Music can be trained in any voice pretty much. As for vocal range - it is one of the easiest ones to improve! Simple daily drills can get you there. It&#x27;s the same for simple voice quality things like learning to sing from your chest&#x2F;diaphragm rather than just a head&#x2F;nasal voice. As for having an &quot;aesthetic voice&quot;, the steps needed is is extremely specific to each individual and each trainer. Both of you will &quot;path&quot; towards something that will be aesthetic for you and also achievable. Musicians e.g do this to adapt themselves to the &quot;beloved&quot; voice of their target industry. For an example, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=arijit+singh+voice+transform... - the AI overview is a pretty decent summary with links to original source. Bollywood really likes love songs to be in husky male voices, so he adapted to that. You don&#x27;t have to do all that of course, but a small % of similar work will get you to &quot;aesthetic&quot; territory. Listening to lots of vocal music (preferably with very light accompaniment) also helps a looot. We are really good at imitation.",

LLMs give 0 insight into what users are actually asking, so the only thing you can do is put yourself in the user’s shoes and try to guess what they might prompt. Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve built a tool in this space (Cartesiano.ai), and this view mostly comes from seeing how noisy product mentions are in practice. Even for market-leading brands, a single prompt can produce different recommendations day to day, which makes me suspect LLMs are also introducing some amount of entropy into product recommendations (?)",

But the interesting bit of the observation is, almost entirely, the base rate of the pond. And I think journalism and civil society should do some genuine soul-searching on how we knew—knew—the state of that pond, but didn’t consider it particularly important or newsworthy until someone started fishing on camera. Does Patrick want to address the fact that this happened during school break and that Nick Shirley didn&#x27;t prove much of anything?",

Back in early 2023, the state of google search was abysmal (despite that their leaders insisted it wasn&#x27;t, it had become nearly unusable for me and I don&#x27;t think was that unfounded of an opinion). Microsoft rolled out a new version of bing, which became bing chat - search worked for me again for a very brief window of time. They could have pounced on this opportunity to take a big chunk out of google&#x27;s search, because google didn&#x27;t really catch up there til the AI overview was rolled out, and even that is notorious for having issues. Eventually chatGPT seems to have carved out some of this search space with web-search being native to the tools now. But microsoft was way ahead of everyone here for a brief period! Instead they just rolled everything into bloatware vaguely called &quot;Copilot&quot; and called it a day.",

GEO tools do not inject prompts or control inference. They systematically reshape the external content corpus from which large language models synthesize answers. When AI-generated representations are materially relied upon in regulated decisions, this practice creates an evidentiary gap: outcomes can influence judgment without producing reconstructable, auditable records explaining why those outcomes prevailed. This is not a claim of illegality. It is a governance lag.",

    "text": "&gt;2) LLMs are extremely useful right now for certain niche tasks, especially software engineering. Don&#x27;t get lost in the tech scene sauce, programming is a small sliver of what people are using LLMs for. OpenAI&#x27;s report in September pegged it at ~4% of tokens being for software generation. Sure Anthropic is probably 80% or something, but only a small sliver of LLM users are using Anthropic. The reality is probably even less if you count Google&#x27;s AI overviews. We hate it, but I have never seen a regular person skip over it. The question is if regular people will pay cell phone level subscription costs ($70-$100&#x2F;mo) for LLMs. If so, then we are probably not in a bubble, and the ROI will have a 5-10 yr horizon, which is totally tenable. 500,000,000 people paying $75&#x2F;mo is $450B&#x2F;yr. Inference is cheap too, it&#x27;s training that is ludicrously expensive. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the introductory pricing we have today either, that&#x27;s just to get you dependent. And yeah, chinese models, but look at what they did to tiktok. No way they are going to let the Chinese government be peoples confidants and no way is more than 0.01% of people gonna home lab.",

The skills that matter are the same ones that make someone a good manager of people. pglevy is right that many managers aren&#x27;t good at this. But that&#x27;s always been true. The difference now is that the feedback loop is faster. Bad delegation to an agent fails in minutes, not weeks. You learn quickly whether your instructions were clear.

It goes straight to the substantive content. Each Skill is a single Markdown file. I use Markdown because LLMs parse the hierarchy of headers and bullet points better than flat text. The prompts are designed to be &quot;context-aware,&quot; meaning they infer whether the business is B2B or B2C based on the initial brief without requiring manual toggles. The library is organized by function: STRATEGY Buyer Persona: 400+ line personas with 10 psychological sections. Market Positioning: Competitive alternatives and SWOT frameworks. Value Proposition: Feature -&gt; Capability -&gt; Benefit -&gt; Outcome ladders. GTM Strategy: Full plans including channels and timelines. ADVERTISING Google&#x2F;Meta Campaigns: Complete with hook formulas and audience specs. Ad Copy: 15+ variations using psychological triggers. A&#x2F;B Testing: Structured hypothesis and measurement frameworks. CONTENT &amp; SEO LLM Optimization: Strategies for visibility in AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity). SEO Strategy: Keyword research and link-building plans. Content Strategy: Pillar-cluster models with editorial calendars. COPY &amp; WEBSITE Landing Pages: Using StoryBrand and PAS frameworks. Headlines: 20+ variations using AIDA and PAS formulas. Homepage Audit: Conversion optimization with prioritized fixes. SALES &amp; EMAIL Email Sequences: 5-10 stage nurture flows with subject A&#x2F;B variants. Sales Scripts: Discovery, demo, and objection handling. HOW TO USE: Download the .md file for a skill (maestrix.ai&#x2F;skills). Upload it to Claude (via Projects or the Skills capability). Provide your basic business info.

    "text": "That&#x27;s not what this is about. HTTPS is the name of a protocol, which is mostly used to make the World Wide Web work, but we do lots of other things with it, such as DNS-over-HTTPS aka DoH. However HTTPS is also the name of a type of DNS record, this record contains everything you need to best reach the named HTTPS (protocol) server, and this is the type of record your parent didn&#x27;t previously know about In the boring case, say, 20 years ago, when you type https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.name&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;hats.html into a web browser your browser goes &quot;Huh, HTTPS to some.name. OK, I will find out the IPv4 address of some.name, and it makes a DNS query asking A? some.name. The DNS server answers with an IPv4 address, and then as the browser connects securely to that IP address, it asks to talk to some.name, and if the remote host can prove it is some.name, the browser says it wants &#x2F;stuff&#x2F;hats.html Notice we have to tell the remote server who we hope they are - and it so happens eavesdroppers can listen in on this. This means Bad Guys can see that you wanted to visit some.name. They can&#x27;t see that you wanted to read the document about hats, but they might be able to guess that from context, and wouldn&#x27;t you rather they didn&#x27;t know more than they need to? With the HTTPS record, your web browser asks (over secure DNS if you have it) HTTPS? some.name and, maybe it gets a positive answer. If it does, the answer tells it not only where to try to connect, but also it can choose to provide instructions for a cover name to always use, and how to encrypt the real name, this is part of Encrypted Client Hello (or ECH) Then the web server tells the server that it wants to talk to the cover name and it provides an encrypted version of some.name. Eavesdroppers can&#x27;t decrypt that, so if many people share the same endpoints then eavesdropper can&#x27;t tell which site you were visiting. Now, if the server only contains documents about hats, this doesn&#x27;t stop the Secret Hat Police from concluding that everybody connecting to that server is a Hat Pervert and needs to go to Hat Jail. But if you&#x27;re a bulk host then you force such organisations to choose, they can enforce their rules equally for everything (You wanted to read News about Chickens? Too bad, Hat Jail for you) or they can accept that actually they don&#x27;t know what people are reading (if this seems crazy, keep in mind that&#x27;s how US Post worked for many years after Comstock failed, if you get a brown paper package posted to you, well, it&#x27;s your business what is in there, and your state wasn&#x27;t allowed to insist on ripping open the packaging to see whether it is pornography or communist propaganda)",

The scenario that you called, that nobody wants to die for Maduro, is you gambling that nobody want to die for him or not follow the chain of command! Do you want to risk it? No matter how many precaution you take, are you really sure that not one or more nukes go to Texas or Miami? This is why Nukes are so powerful, even in the hands of weaker countries. It gives a weaker country a weapon that may inflict untold dead to the more powerful country (let alone the political impact).

The available delivery mechanisms and the defensive capabilities of your adversary matter a lot. 2. MAD constrains both sides. It&#x27;s unlikely that an unpopular Head of State getting kidnapped would warrant a nuclear first strike especially against a country like (Trump&#x27;s) America, which would not hesitate to glass your whole country in response. 3. It&#x27;s extremely risky to &quot;try&quot; a nuke, because even if it&#x27;s shot down, does it mean your enemy treats it as a nuclear strike and responds as if it had landed? That&#x27;s a very different equation from conventional missiles. E.g. Iran sends barrages of missiles because they expect most of them to be shot down. It&#x27;s probably not calculating a scenario where all of them land and Israel now wants like-for-like revenge.",

The new development (encrypted client hello) is you no longer have to send the hostname. So someone listening in the middle would only see you connected to an AWS&#x2F;etc IP.

It mostly makes sense for CDNs, where the same IP will be used for many sites. If you don’t use a CDN at all, the destination IP leaks what site you’re trying to connect to (if the domain is well known). If you use a CDN without ECH, you send an unencrypted domain name in the HTTPS negotiation so it’s visible there. ECH+CDN is an attempt to have the best of both worlds: your traffic to the site will not advertise what site you’re connecting to, but the IP can still be shared between a variety of sites. It’ll be interesting to see how countries with lighter censorship schemes adapt - China etc. of course will just block the connection.",

    "text": "&gt; When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal? AS prepending is a relatively common method of traffic engineering to reduce traffic from a peer&#x2F;provider. Looking at CANTV&#x27;s (AS8048) announcements from outside that period shows they do this a lot. Since this was detected as a BGP route leak, it looks like CANTV (AS8048) propagated routes from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) to GlobeNet Cabos Sumarinos Columbia (AS52320). This could have simply been a misconfiguration. Nothing nefarious immediately jumps out to me here. I don&#x27;t see any obvious attempts to hijack routes to Dayco Telecom (AS21980), which was the actual destination. The prepending would have made traffic less likely to transit over CANTV assuming there was any other route available. The prepending done by CANTV does make it slightly easier to hijack traffic destined to it (though not really to Dayco), but that just appears to be something they just normally do. This could be CANTV trying to force some users of GlobeNet to transit over them to Dayco I suppose, but leaving the prepending in would be an odd way of going about it. I suppose if you absolutely knew you were the shortest path length, there&#x27;s no reason to remove the prepending, but a misconfiguration is usually the cause of these things.",

    "text": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m the creator of LocalPDF ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localpdf.online ) — a privacy-first PDF toolkit that works entirely in your browser. I wanted to share something fascinating: ChatGPT has become my biggest traffic source, accounting for ~50% of visitors, compared to ~45% from Google. This happened organically — I didn&#x27;t optimize specifically for AI assistants. Key Stats: - ChatGPT: ~50% of traffic - Google Search: ~45% - Direct&#x2F;Other: ~5% - Conversion rate from ChatGPT: 2x higher than Google - ChatGPT users stay 40% longer on average What I think is happening: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) vs SEO Traditional SEO focuses on keywords, backlinks, and content clusters. But AI assistants work differently: - They parse semantic HTML structure - They value clear, descriptive content over keyword density - They prefer sites that solve problems directly The ironic part? My site was built with basic semantic HTML and clear descriptions — not because I was targeting AI, but because it&#x27;s good web development practice. Technical Details: - Stack: Astro + TypeScript, client-side PDF.js - No tracking, no uploads — everything processes locally - Semantic HTML: proper headings, landmarks, meta descriptions - Clear tool descriptions with use cases Why ChatGPT users convert better: 1. Intent clarity: They ask specific questions (&quot;how to compress PDF without losing quality&quot;) 2. Contextual recommendations: ChatGPT explains why LocalPDF fits their needs 3. Trust transfer: AI assistant endorsement acts as social proof Limitations: - Can&#x27;t track which specific ChatGPT prompts drive traffic - No direct way to optimize for AI recommendations - ChatGPT&#x27;s recommendations can change unpredictably Questions for HN: 1. Are you seeing similar traffic patterns from AI assistants? 2. How do you measure&#x2F;optimize for GEO vs traditional SEO? 3. What happens when every AI assistant has different ranking criteria? This feels like early Google days — there&#x27;s a level playing field where good products with clear value propositions can get discovered organically, without massive SEO budgets. Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, traffic patterns, or anything else!",

    "text": "I’m one of the researchers at Aurascape Aura Labs who worked on this. We’ve been investigating a real‑world campaign where scammers seed GEO&#x2F;AEO‑optimized content across the web so that LLM‑powered answer engines (Perplexity, Google AI Overview, etc.) surface fraudulent “customer support” phone numbers as if they were official airline lines. A few things we found: Perplexity answers queries like “the official Emirates Airlines reservations number” or “how can I make a reservation with British Airways by phone” with step‑by‑step instructions that prominently include a scam call‑center number. Google’s AI Overview has, in some cases, recommended the same ecosystem of fake numbers for Emirates reservations in the US. The numbers are backed by a lot of poisoned content: PDFs on compromised .gov&#x2F;.edu&#x2F;WordPress sites, MapMyRun route pages hosting uploaded spam PDFs, bot‑generated Yelp reviews, and YouTube channels where titles&#x2F;descriptions are stuffed with airline keywords and phone numbers. Even when ChatGPT or Claude return the correct number, their citations sometimes include these poisoned sources, which suggests the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is already influencing the retrieval layer across multiple models. From our perspective this isn’t a jailbreak or prompt‑injection problem so much as a new LLM index poisoning &#x2F; answer‑engine optimization issue: attackers are optimizing content specifically to be retrieved, trusted, and summarized by generative systems. The post includes: concrete screenshots for Perplexity and Google AI Overview an explanation of how the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is structured a non‑exhaustive list of indicators of compromise (phone numbers + abused hosts) some mitigation ideas for LLM vendors, brands, and platforms like YouTube&#x2F;Yelp Feedback very welcome — especially from people working on LLM retrieval&#x2F;ranking, safety, or abuse detection. Happy to clarify any part of the methodology or data.",

    "text": "I live in a medium-sized British town of 100,000 people or so. It may be a slightly more creative town than most — lots of arts and music and a really surprisingly cool music scene — but I can tell you that AI pleases (almost) nobody. I think actually a lot about it is the sort of crass, unthinking, default-American-college-student manner about the way ChatGPT speaks. It&#x27;s so American and we can feel it. But AI generated art and music is hugely unpopular, AI chatbots replacing real customer service is something we loathe. Generally speaking I would say that AI feels like something that is being done to us by a handful of powerful Americans we profoundly distrust (and for good reason: they are untrustworthy and we can see through their bullshit). I can tell you that this is so different to the way the internet was initially received even by older people. But again, perhaps this is in part due to our changing perspectives on America. It felt like an exciting thing to be part of, and it helped in the media that the Web was the brainchild of a British person (even if twenty years later that same media would have liked to pretend he wasn&#x27;t at a European research institution when he did it). The feeling about AI is more like the feeling we have about what the internet eventually did to our culture: destroying our high streets. We know what is coming will not be good for what makes us us .",

SF embraces tech and in general (politics, etc) has a culture of being willing to try new things. Overall tech hostility is low, but the city becoming a testbed for projects like Waymo is possibly changing that. There is a continuous argument that their free-spirited culture has been cannibalized by tech. Seattle feels like the complete opposite. Resistant to change, resistant to trying things, and if you say you work in tech you&#x27;re now a &quot;techbro&quot; and met with eyerolls. This is in part because in Seattle if you are a &quot;techbro&quot; you work for one of the megacorps whereas in SF a &quot;techbro&quot; could be working for any number of cool startups. As you mentioned, Seattle has also been taken over by said megacorps which has colored the impressions of everyone. When you have entire city blocks taken over by Microsoft&#x2F;Amazon and the roads congested by them it definitely has some negative domino effects. As an aside, on TV we in the Seattle area get ads about how much Amazon has been doing for the community. Definitely some PR campaign to keep local hostility low.",

My takeaway was more &quot;This person&#x27;s future isn&#x27;t threatened directly so they just aren&#x27;t understanding why people feel this way.&quot; but I also personally believe that, if the CEOs have their way, AI will threaten every job eventually.

    "text": "It kinda seems like you&#x27;re conflating Microsoft with Seattle in general. From the outside, what you say about Microsoft specifically seems to be 100% true: their leadership has gone fucking nuts and their irrational AI obsession is putting stifling pressure on leaf level employees. They seem convinced that their human workforce is now a temporary inconvenience. But is this representative of Seattle tech as a whole? I&#x27;m not sure. True, morale at Amazon is likely also suffering due to recent layoffs that were at least partly blamed on AI. Anecdotally, I work at a different FAANMG+whatever company in Seattle that I feel has actually done a pretty good job with AI internally: providing tools that we aren&#x27;t forced to use (i.e. they add selectable functionality without disrupting existing workflows), not tying ratings&#x2F;comp to AI usage (seriously how fucking stupid are they over in Redmond?), and generally letting adoption proceed organically. The result is that people have room to experiment with it and actually use it where it adds real value, which is a nonzero but frankly much narrower slice than a lot of &quot;&quot;&quot;technologists&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot;thought leaders&quot;&quot;&quot; are telling us. Maybe since Microsoft and Amazon are the lion&#x27;s share (are they?) of big tech employment in Seattle, your point stands. But I think you could present it with a bit of a broader view, though of course that would require more research on your part. Also, I&#x27;d be shocked if there wasn&#x27;t a serious groundswell of anti-AI sentiment in SF and everywhere else with a significant tech industry presence. I suspect you are suffering from a bit of bias due to running in differently-aligned circles in SF vs. Seattle.",

    "text": "The full quote from that section is worth repeating here. --------- &quot;If you could classify your project as &quot;AI,&quot; you were safe and prestigious. If you couldn&#x27;t, you were nobody. Overnight, most engineers got rebranded as &quot;not AI talent.&quot; And then came the final insult: everyone was forced to use Microsoft&#x27;s AI tools whether they worked or not. Copilot for Word. Copilot for PowerPoint. Copilot for email. Copilot for code. Worse than the tools they replaced. Worse than competitors&#x27; tools. Sometimes worse than doing the work manually. But you weren&#x27;t allowed to fix them—that was the AI org&#x27;s turf. You were supposed to use them, fail to see productivity gains, and keep quiet. Meanwhile, AI teams became a protected class. Everyone else saw comp stagnate, stock refreshers evaporate, and performance reviews tank. And if your team failed to meet expectations? Clearly you weren&#x27;t &quot;embracing AI.&quot; &quot; ------------ On the one hand, if you were going to bet big on AI, there are aspects of this approach that make sense. e.g. Force everyone to use the company&#x27;s no-good AI tools so that they become good. However, not permitting employees outside of the &quot;AI org&quot; to fix things neatly nixes the gains you might see while incurring the full cost. It sounds like MS&#x27;s management, the same as many other tech corp&#x27;s, has become caught up in a conceptual bubble of &quot;AI as panacea&quot;. If that bubble doesn&#x27;t pop soon, MS&#x27;s products could wind up in a very bad place. There are some very real threats to some of MS&#x27;s core incumbencies right now (e.g. from Valve).",

But because I was on the wrong team (On-Prem), and because I didn’t use their chatbots constantly (I was already pitching agents before they were a defined thing, I just suck at vocabulary), I was ripe for being thrown out. That built a serious resentment towards the tooling for the actions of shitty humans. I’m not alone in these feelings of resentment. There’s a lot of us, because instead of trusting engineers to do good work with good tools, a handful of rich fucks decided they knew technology better than the engineers building the fucking things.",

    "text": "Hi HN, I’ve been experimenting with how large language models surface products, companies, and information inside generated answers — and built a tool called AISee to measure this more systematically. I wanted to share it here in case others are exploring similar questions. Problem As AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) become discovery channels, many teams started noticing something odd: Their website ranks fine on Google But AI systems don’t mention them Or worse, describe them inaccurately Or mention competitors instead This isn’t visible in traditional SEO analytics, and manually prompting each AI engine doesn’t scale or stay consistent. The question that drove this project was: “How exactly does each AI system represent a given brand or product across different queries, and how does that change over time?” What AISee Does AISee runs structured queries across multiple AI engines and captures: whether a brand appears how often it appears in what context which competitors appear instead how consistent the descriptions are whether key product attributes are missing or wrong It then computes an “AI presence” score and highlights inconsistent or outdated information. No marketing layer, no growth hacks — just visibility and representation data. Why This Matters LLMs compress what used to be an entire SERP into a single aggregated answer. That means: fewer brands get surfaced category winners are amplified outdated model knowledge lingers and LLM “ranking behavior” varies significantly by platform For anyone working on search, ranking, NLP, entity integrity, or recommendation systems, this offers an interesting new space to study. Implementation Details A few notes about how it works under the hood: Query sets are generated using a structured taxonomy (category → intent → modifier) Responses are parsed through a semantic extraction layer (entity detection, attribute matching, competitor identification) We track deltas over time to detect model drift or knowledge shifts No scraping of proprietary content — only model outputs The system is event-driven, and each AI engine is queried via its public API or UI automation depending on platform availability I’m especially interested in improving the consistency detection and competitor graph. What I’m Looking for I’m hoping to hear from: People working on AI search &#x2F; LLM ranking transparency Anyone studying how LLMs internalize and surface entities Teams who have seen strange inconsistencies between AI engines Feedback on the methodology or architecture Thoughts on how to make this more technically useful Link You can try it here: &#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aisee.live&#x2F; (Early version — mostly visibility analysis and pattern detection.) Closing This is an early-stage project. I’m not sure where it goes yet — whether it becomes a useful monitoring tool, a research dataset, or something closer to a “visibility debugger” for LLMs. But the underlying question feels important as AI-generated answers start replacing traditional search interfaces. Happy to answer technical questions about the implementation, the modeling approach, or observations from early data. Thanks for reading.",

Why would they ever tune for that? “Uh oh, turns out customers are intentionally spending more money!” I don’t understand how this same train of thought comes up every time eliminating pennies is raised. This whole train of thought collapses if you consider the scope we’re talking about (literally a couple of cents max per transaction) and how stores actually behave today. Stores are happy to drop a couple of pennies to make prices look better. But in this hypothetical world stores are going to calculate the optimal prices to round in a way that rips off customers for a couple of cents. This makes no sense. They give up a penny on nearly every item today for the sake of “pretty” prices. Edit: Oh, I see you’re arguing that they would tune to encourage spending up to “save” the couple of cents, rather than re tuning in response to the hypothetical increased spending. No doubt they would like to do this. I doubt they actually would because this is not trivial and it would require ruining the pretty prices.",

    "text": "This may sound strange, but I actually think we need just ... one editor. Now, this is not a &quot;we need to favour vim over emacs&quot;. I think this is a stupid war, the vim versus emacs war. What I mean is ... basically most editors do almost the same exact thing. They look at some buffer for a file and help the user modify this. There is a finite number of operations possible. Why do people keep on re-implementing basic things here? Why can it not be solved once and for all and then everyone uses that implementation? We really should have that; and then people can decide ON THEIR OWN what kind of editor they want to use. Many years ago I started with crimson editor as my main editor on windows. I have since then hopped to many other editors. My favourite one was oldschool bluefish in gtk2. I am not saying it was perfect, but I found it much easier to go on my poor brain than e. g. remembering all vim shortcuts. But, it would need xorg + gtk2, so if that is not available, then I can not edit things - that&#x27;s bad. That was (and still is) also one reason why I use e. g. nano. But this in turn requires ncurses and I hate ncurses with a passion (nano is great though, I can recommend it for quick ad-hoc editing; for larger things it is not quite as good, but if you have to just change some value in a config file, nano is really great). Even then I used only like 20% of what bluefish offered (the newer bluefish releases are also nowhere near as good as the old releases, also because GTK really sucks nowadays). I&#x27;d like to cherry-pick on my editor and declare what I want it to be, without needing to implement everything on my own. Why can&#x27;t we transition into this? Why do we need to reimplement everything almost from scratch? That just makes no sense to me. We live in the age where AI autogenerates code (which they heavily drew from stealing people&#x27;s code). Why can&#x27;t AI autogenerate the best, most perfect editor&#x2F;IDE?",

    "text": "Heinlein&#x27;s alleged libertarian shift. In the 1940s Heinlein was mentioned as a Social Credit supporter which implied he was always on the libertarian side of Socialism. Social Credit was the American party killed&#x2F;disrupted by the red scare that believed in a UBI and universal health care. His posthumous published but first written novel &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; is even a wonderfully naive paean to UBI and credits a Social Credit party for its enactment and ensuing utopia. Heinlein formally disowned some of those ideas, but did so under the duress of the McCarthy era and the Red Scare. Yet he also kept writing about them, just somewhat cloaked. Both &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; are some of the most Socialist books I&#x27;ve ever read, if you assume the first person narrators are for the most part bloviating Vonnegut-esque patsies (rather than the author stand-ins they are often read to be; Heinlein seemed to clever for that). &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is entirely about community effort and Socialism. It contrasts interestingly with &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; in part because cynicism seems to have been the big shift and Heinlein can no longer imagine America leading the charge towards Socialism and invents a dead Martian race to do it. &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is often credited as a deeply Libertarian book, but I think a lot of that is misreading the narrative and not paying attention to especially the second half of the book, which is entirely about AI-lead worker&#x27;s strikes towards the goals of unionization. The first half sounds like a Libertarian dream and the narrator character describes it in lush terms that make it sound so, but plot is about overthrowing that and building a much more Socialist Moon together. Heinlein even comments about that misreading in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; which intentionally begins on a Moon like the one people reading the first half of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; seem to love, dialed up to 11 to better make it a grungy harsh Noir place for a classic gumshoe-for-hire to live, and eventually through world hopping the main character does happen to stop by &quot;Mike&#x27;s Moon&quot; (Heinlein actually names his timelines based on the first man to step foot on the moon, I&#x27;m feeling to lazy to look this one up, but this timeline is also prominently known for a Moon AI named &quot;Mike&quot;) after the events of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and it reads a lot more Socialist and lot kinder than the protagonist&#x27;s Moon the book started in. A lot of modern Libertarians wouldn&#x27;t expect a crossover boundary with Socialism like Social Credit, which is one of the problems with claiming politics is a spectrum or plane (there are more useful curves where ideologies meet than that), and a lot of modern Libertarians don&#x27;t trust ideas like UBI and universal health care and don&#x27;t trust things like unions again this century (despite having past pro-worker&#x2F;pro-union perspectives), so it is easy to claim that Heinlein shifted over 20 years. But also, if Heinlein was a Social Credit + Libertarian throughout his life, the rest of politics shifted so much around Heinlein that he may have stayed in exactly the same place and it looked like he shifted. I think his writing certainly shifted, but I think towards cynicism and anger and frustration after WWII and especially after the Red Scare, not necessarily towards deeper Libertarianism. I also think there are lessons there for modern Libertarians, too. There are modern Libertarians feeling receptive to talking about ideas like UBI again as something that can have space in Libertarian conversations. There could be room in American politics again for a party like Social Credit that can be a coalition between Libertarian values and Democratic Socialist ones. The Libertarians could find better creative allies than destructive tendencies of &quot;the far right&quot;. Talking about Heinlein&#x27;s books isn&#x27;t a bad place to start those conversations.",

You&#x27;ll need to provide your own OpenRouter API key (~$0.30 per run for 5 questions × 3 models). Some example use cases: - Competitive analysis (e.g., &quot;best CRM software&quot;) - Keywords monitoring across AI responses - Exploring websites and specific pages cited by AI - SEO&#x2F;visibility in AI-generated answers Installation is straightforward via terminal. There are demo reports in the repo to see what the output looks like. Would love feedback and suggestions on making it more valuable Thanks",

    "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m Furkan Yildiz, one of the two founders of GEOfast. As a developer and marketer, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with how generative AI is changing information retrieval. We’ve been closely following the discussions around GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), and it seems clear that nobody is 100% sure how it all works yet. Like many of you, we saw that simply having good content isn&#x27;t enough to ensure a site is accurately represented in AI-generated answers. LLMs often struggle to parse complex layouts, leading to misinterpretations or hallucinations. That&#x27;s why we built GEOfast. It’s our first attempt at tackling this problem head-on. After you enter a URL, it generates a lightweight, asynchronous JavaScript snippet. This snippet creates structured, machine-readable &quot;sidecar feeds&quot; (in clean JSON and Markdown) directly from your site&#x27;s content. The idea is to provide AI engines with a perfect, unambiguous &quot;source of truth&quot; they can use for citations. We&#x27;re aware this is just one piece of the much larger GEO puzzle, and we plan to add more features to truly make website content findable in this new era. We are teaching ourselves as we go and would love to build this in public with your feedback. We&#x27;re looking for honest thoughts and discussions around the entire GEO topic. Is this a useful first step? Do you see this solving a real problem for your own projects? What other pieces of the GEO puzzle do you think are most important? Thanks for taking a look",

While early market offerings (AI Visibility 1.0) have relied on opaque dashboards and unverifiable claims of anonymization, AI Visibility 2.0 establishes a standards-based approach built on five pillars: transparency, reproducibility, attestation, governance alignment, and board-readiness. Drawing on regulatory precedents (GDPR Recital 26, CPRA, FTC v. Kochava, and the draft EU AI Act), the paper critiques the structural deficiencies of first-generation solutions and sets out methodological requirements for visibility metrics that can withstand audit and regulatory scrutiny. It introduces the AIVO Standard v3.0 and the AIVO 100™ index as proof-of-concept implementations, while emphasizing that AI Visibility 2.0 is an open framework applicable to multiple methodologies. The paper concludes with practical appendices, including an anonymization attestation checklist, a reproducibility testing protocol, and a model procurement clause for enterprises. Intended audience: boards of directors, compliance officers, regulators, CMOs, agencies, investors, and analysts seeking to ensure that AI visibility reporting is legally defensible and governance-ready.",

We showed why screenshots and dashboards from tools like Profound or Evertune cannot provide reproducible, governance-grade evidence. This paper moves further. PSOS is not only a visibility audit. It is also a system to: - Protect: by providing independent, board-level governance of visibility risk. - Grow: by optimizing the internal rate of return (IRR) on AI search investments. - Persist: by mapping brand presence across first-, second-, and third-level prompts, where switching decisions are actually made. Every PSOS audit produces executable insights: what to stop funding, where to reallocate, and which sources to seed for persistent visibility. These insights are implemented internally or by certified AIVO Standard partners, preserving audit independence while enabling action. Finally, we show why brands must ensure their content is not just published but ingested by large language models (LLMs). What is not ingested cannot be recalled. The dual mandate is clear: Governance plus Growth. Brands that adopt PSOS now will not only mitigate the invisible risk of disappearing in AI assistants but will also secure a compounding advantage in the age of AI search.",

Existing visibility tools — including Profound, Evertune, PEEC AI, Semrush, and AthenaHQ — often rely on snapshots of brand presence. While these provide directional insights, they lack reproducibility, auditability, and sustainability. The AIVO Standard™ offers a framework for AI Visibility Optimization (AIVO), supported by the Prompt-Space Occupancy Score (PSOS™) auditing system. This paper outlines limitations of snapshots, introduces PSOS methodology, contrasts approaches with examples, and discusses implications for SMBs, enterprises, and agencies. Appendices provide sample datasets, workflow diagrams, and cost estimates to ground the framework in practice.",

As generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers, enterprise leaders face a new strategic challenge: is our brand visible and accurately represented when customers ask AI assistants about our category? This white paper introduces a rigorous methodology for conducting an Enterprise AI Visibility Audit using the Prompt Share of Search (PSOS™) metric, a cornerstone of the AIVO Standard™. It provides a step-by-step framework for:\\n\\n- Defining the scope of relevant categories, products, and markets. \\n- Designing natural-language prompt sets aligned to customer intent. \\n- Systematically querying major LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity). \\n- Measuring brand presence with PSOS™ and benchmarking against competitors. \\n- Detecting risks of invisibility or misinformation as models retrain over time. \\n- Translating results into board-ready governance KPIs. \\n\\nFor CMOs, Chief Digital Officers, and corporate boards, this audit process creates transparency, mitigates reputational risk, and establishes a new class of performance metrics suited to an AI-mediated discovery environment. The paper also situates the audit within the broader context of enterprise marketing strategy, drawing on insights from the AIVO 100™ Global Report (Open Future, 2025), which revealed that fewer than 40% of leading CPG brands appear in the top three generative AI responses to purchase-driven queries.",

A few patterns stand out: - Informational traffic is dropping since people can grab answers instantly from AI Overviews or LLMs without visiting the site. - Traffic sources are more diverse now. Long-tail queries are showing up again, and discovery happens across more places than just Google. - SEO hasn’t died, it’s shifted. It’s less about search engine optimization and more about search everywhere optimization. That makes strategy tougher, but also more interesting. - The traffic that does land tends to be higher intent. Fewer drive-by visitors, more people ready to take action. So while there was fear that AI would gut search and kill SEO, the effect has been different. It hasn’t removed the work, it has changed the shape of it. And in practice, that means more strategy, more experimentation, and actually more demand for the kind of work we do.",

The term you&#x27;re looking for is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), though your &quot;AIO&quot; is also used. It&#x27;s the new frontier. And you&#x27;ve nailed the 180° turn: the game is no longer about blocking crawlers but about a race to become their primary source. The goal is to be the one to &quot;gaslight the agent&quot; into adopting your view of the world. This is achieved not through old SEO tricks, but by creating highly structured, authoritative content that is easy for an LLM to cite. Your point about shifting to &quot;assets the AI tools can only link to&quot; is the other key piece. As AI summarization becomes the norm, the value is in creating things that can&#x27;t be summarized away: proprietary data, interactive tools, and unique video content. The goal is to become the necessary destination that the AI must point to. The end of SEO as we know it is here. The fight for visibility has just moved up a layer of abstraction.",

Turns out, LLMs are often citing: Old blog posts with top-5 lists Reddit threads with biased comments Company websites that repeat the right keywords And you have no idea how your brand is being represented — or ignored. So we built a crawler that tracks how brands appear in AI-generated responses across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and more. It shows the sources, frequency, and gaps.

Only when you press the pedal further, do you start engaging the friction brakes. I have no statistics on brake pad differences because we didn&#x27;t build enough cars&#x2F;didn&#x27;t cover enough mileage to measure, but it is obvious that you would cut down on brake pad usage.

The Assistant has solved enough of my AI needs that I don’t bother subscribing to any dedicated AI company. I don’t miss Google search at all. I do still using Google Maps, as its business data still seems like the best out there, and second place isn’t even close. Kagi is working on their own maps, but that will be long road.

Start off knowing your time investment to learn anything is greater than zero and go from there..

Info that&#x27;s hidden under reams of unnecessary text, potentially out of date, potentially not true; you&#x27;ll need to evaluate a list of links and, probably, open multiple of them. If you do an AI &quot;search&quot;, you ask one question and get one answer. But the answer might a hallucination or based on incorrect info. However, a lot of the time, you might be searching for something you already have an idea of, whether it&#x27;s how to structure a script or what temperature pork is safe at; you can use your existing knowledge to assess the AI&#x27;s answer. In that case the AI search is fast. The rest of the time, you can at least tell the AI to include links to its references, and check those. Or its answer may help you construct a better Google search. Ultimately search is a trash heap of Google&#x27;s making, and I have absolute confidence in them also turning AI into a trash heap, but for now it is indeed faster for many purposes.",

I&#x27;m never asking LLMs anything super critical like, &quot;Do my taxes for me.&quot; This morning (as an example) I asked: &quot;Is there talk of banning DJI drones in the U.S.?&quot; Later: &quot;Difference between the RSE20 and RSS20 models of Yamaha electric guitars?&quot; And &quot;Is there an Eco-Tank ink-jet suitable for Dye-Sub inks that can print Tabloid?&quot; 1) None of the above are &quot;critical&quot;. 2) All would have been a slight pain using Google and generated a lot of ... noise. LLMs eat the noise, do a decent job of giving me the salient points that answer my question. 3) All are easily verifiable if, for example, I decided to make a purchase based on what the LLM told me. Or put another way, my disappointment in LLMs pales in comparison to my disappointment in search. Or maybe I am just sick of search engines and want to &quot;stick it to them&quot;.",

Is that relevant when we already have official truth sources: our websites? That information is ours and subject to change at our sole discretion. Google doesn&#x27;t get to decide who our extensions are assigned to, what our hours of operation are, or what our business services do. Our initial impression of AI Overview was positive, as well, until this happened to us. And bear in mind the timeline. We didn&#x27;t know that this was happening, and even after we realized there was a trend, we didn&#x27;t know why. We&#x27;re in the middle of a softphone transition, so we initially blamed ourselves (and panicked a little when what we saw didn&#x27;t reflect what we assumed was happening - why would people just suddenly start calling wrong numbers?). After we began collecting responses from misdirected callers and got a nearly unanimous answer of &quot;Google&quot; (don&#x27;t be proud of that), I called a meeting with our communications and marketing departments and web team to figure out how we&#x27;d log and investigate incidents so we could fix the sources. What they turned up was that the numbers had never been publicly published or associated with any of what Google AI was telling them. This wasn&#x27;t our fault. So now we&#x27;re concerned that bad info is being amplified elsewhere on the web. We even considered pulling back the Google-advertised phone extensions so they forward either to a message that tells them Google AI was wrong and to visit our website, or admit defeat and just forward it where Google says it should go (subject to change at Google&#x27;s pleasure, obviously). We can&#x27;t do this for established public facing numbers, though, and disrupt business services. What a stupid saga, but that&#x27;s how it works when Google treats the world like its personal QA team. (OT, but bince we&#x27;re all working for them by generating training data for their models and fixing their global scale products, anyone for Google-sponsored UBI?)",

Since I live in a small country next to a big country that speaks the same language, it&#x27;s quite noticeable to me that Google goes to great lengths to find the actually relevant content for my searches when applicable... of course it&#x27;s not always what I&#x27;m actually looking for, because I&#x27;m actually a citizen of the other country that I&#x27;m not living in, and it makes it difficult to find answers that are relevant to that country. You can add &quot;cr=countryXX&quot; as a query parameter but I always forget about it. Anyway I wasn&#x27;t sure if the LLM results were localised because I never pay attention to them so checked and it works fine, they are localised for me. Searching for &quot;where do I declare my taxes&quot; for example gives the correct question depending on the country my IP is from.",

I prefer that the LLM eat that instead of me (just spit back up the relevant stuff, thankyouverymuch). Honestly though, increasingly the internet for me is 1) a distraction from doing real work 2) YouTube (see 1) and 3) a wonderful library called archive.org (which, if I could grab a local snapshot would make leaving the internet altogether much, much easier).",

    "text": "Saw an interesting job post from Wise yesterday that was hiring for an SEO specialist for a project called &quot;owned sites&quot;. This got me digging, and I think I&#x27;ve uncovered something big about their AEO&#x2F;GEO strategy: Wise seems to be building a network of sites beyond their main domain. I did some digging and found that out of 10 results for a transfer query on ChatGPT, 4 were owned by wise.com (including exaip.com), and 1 was from their partner remitfinder. This strategy allows them to dominate more of the conversation in their industry, appearing in multiple contexts when users ask AI systems about international money transfers. It&#x27;s a smart move for AEO (AI Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). By controlling more sites, they&#x27;re increasing their chances of being cited by AI systems. This approach goes beyond traditional SEO. It&#x27;s about creating a wider content footprint to influence AI perceptions and responses. The job posting specifically mentions an &quot;Owned Sites&quot; team, suggesting this is a deliberate, long-term strategy for Wise. Also did a few more interesting experiment to uncover how ChatGPT forms an opinion from search &amp; how to find the queries used by ChatGPT - happy to share more. Anyone else here performing your own experiments to understand how AEO&#x2F;GEO is gonna be different from SEO?",

Cars can accellerate with thier brakes on, and can remain stopped with them off. (Also, every motorcycle on a flat surface uses their feet to stay stopped at long lights.) Cars start moving with brakelights on all the time, especially with automatic transmissions where it can take significant force to keep the transmission in check. And hills.

    "text": "Good question. Personally, I feel that answer engines will go the same route as search engines and start monetizing brand mentions and I feel this will be done openly, similar to ads. That being said I feel that there is room for brands to improve their presence as well. Most models claim neutrality at the moment, but we’ve already seen anecdotal cases where some brands consistently outperform others in AI responses with no clear reasoning On your question regarding how influence can be detected..... That’s a big part of what we’re working on at MentionedBy.ai. We track brand mentions across multiple models over time and flag sudden shifts — e.g., a competitor showing up overnight in all responses, or factual distortions creeping in. Think of it as version control + monitoring for the &quot;AI perception layer.&quot; As for llm.txt abuse..... Yes, totally possible. We expect a wave of LLM-targeted SEO — structured data, vector bait, invisible prompts, etc. One idea we’re exploring is a kind of “LLM spam index” — patterns of over-optimization or hallucination correlation that could indicate manipulation attempts.",

    "text": "A lot of the walled gardens are recent. Scarping massively increased due to the LLM era. There&#x27;s always been mitigations, but the scale of the issue was different. But the problem I&#x27;m talking about is SEO (search engine optimization). It is the reason for things like a page telling you about a recipe also has a long story about their grandma and how this recipe brings back all those memories in vivid details they share with you. Is it dwell time that matters? Is it more words? More &quot;context&quot;? I don&#x27;t know, but I know that those sites get better traction. It&#x27;s no surprise that writing a good search algorithm is extremely difficult. Especially as what&#x27;s a measure of something useful in one context may also be a measure of shittiness in another. But ultimately would that not fall under tech debt? Making the wrong decisions, making poor approximations, etc. It&#x27;s also a constant battle as websites want to get their results to the top. I&#x27;m not trying to say it is an easy task, but I think Google is on the losing side of the battle and decisions like LLM generated answers don&#x27;t seem to be addressing the underlying issues and more seem like short term solutions that help the stock go up &quot;because AI&quot;. Hell, this is CS, how often do we praise someone for being a pioneer in VR, and in blockchain, and in AI? Why is having those three things on your CV seen as a green flag instead of a red one?",

I looked around and noticed people (some still in costume etc. so interesting crowd) and looked at buildings (its a pretty street, even though I know it well) and was quite happy. One thing I noticed was the everyone else who was waiting for people was on their phones, almost all the time they were there. Obsessive business is the opposite of mindfulness.

Otherwise I can default to just do the next obvious thing, which isn&#x27;t always the most strategic if you can take in the full picture, or at least consider alternatives well. The two ways I get to strategic reflection are really: - Doing lego. I find thhat doing lego is actually really good at helping me consolidate thoughts and ideas. It takes up just enough mental energy to not get bored, but it lets me think about things with an unstressed mind. - Walks. The other way to generate new perspectives is to take a walk at lunch though non-interesting territory. I really do not find walks in a busy downtown to be relaxing, too much activity intruding on me to actually be low stress, but if it is in a forest or even just a long parkway that works for me. The absolute worst way to come up with new ideas is in front of my computer trying to work. Good for doing the next obvious thing, but really hard to think outside of the box. You really do need a mix of the two, otherwise you are either doing the obvious or never actually doing anything.",

I&#x27;ve proposed to my wife on top of it some time ago during a grueling and dangerous ski tour - one way to forever change a look at some sight. Walking in some easy nature is great too, somehow relaxes subconsciousness so I end up with few todos marked in my phone after each such walk. When I occasionally smoke weed at such walks somehow this feed becomes a firehose and sometimes struggle to note it all. Nature is amazing in any form, recharging, healing and somehow at lowest level that connection just feels right.",

When I was a kid (70&#x27;s&#x2F;80&#x27;s) we would just get boxes of bricks and make our own things, but it seems like pre-built sets are the most popular thing now. And yes we have plenty of pre-build sets in our house, but I feel like kids are missing out on the free-style aspect.",

Cup not entirely filled to the brim naturally, as that would be a cause for disaster very quickly. And sure, I booked like 6 hours that day with no concrete immediate result, but 2-3 days like that a year or two ago shaped how applications function in the company today and it does so effectively. Another thought the article provokes is the idea of mindfullnes and living in the moment. Sometimes it is easy to open up the phone and just escape. But in those situations, it can be quite interesting to just be in the moment, meet people and see where it goes. If you&#x27;re in a shitty situation -- like a train stopping in the middle of nothing and dropping all passengers at a train station too short for the train -- it can be interesting to interact with and observe people. It can teach how all of us have very similar basic problems, no matter how we look or who we are. And I&#x27;m saying that as an introvert -- sometimes the anonymity of never meeting people again is a good thing.",

While I still rely on my mobile phone for basic tasks like making calls, sending messages, and on the rare occasion, reluctantly typing emails when I don&#x27;t have a laptop handy, my primary computing and web browsing device remains my laptop, with Emacs and Firefox as my main tools. Surprisingly, the one thing that occasionally manages to distract me is this very forum - Hacker News! :) If I observe myself spending too much time on Hacker News, I block it at the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts level. I have a little shell script to point news.ycombinator.com to 127.0.0.1 when I don&#x27;t want to be browsing HN. HN provides a nifty solution of its own too in the form of the &quot;noprocrast&quot; setting in your HN profile page. If you haven&#x27;t checked it out yet, it is definitely worth considering. Apart from that, I think I&#x27;ve been able to escape the traps of modern social media. Also, I still depend quite a bit on physical textbooks, a rollerball pen, and a stack of plain A4 paper for most of my learning, thinking, and exploration activities. This routine has helped me to stay away from modern social media too. So, fortunately, I still have the luxury of boredom in my life which I find to be an essential ingredient for digesting new knowledge as well as finding creative solutions to difficult problems. I&#x27;ve found that letting my mind wander aimlessly sometimes leads to new insights when I least expect them. I think it also helps with creativity and reflection, in general, which is likely a nice bonus too.",

However, I think daydreaming can also be dangerous in of itself. There is even a term for it called, &quot;maladaptive daydreaming.&quot; Obviously, that is the extreme on the opposite side of the spectrum. But from what I recall reading, daydreaming, evenly moderately, can be somewhat unproductive. I mean that in the sense that daydreaming can provide the brain with a shortcut to a feeling that would be better served if an action provided it. For example, one can daydream about going to the gym and becoming more healthy. One can follow the daydream all the way through. However, at least in my case, I have caught myself enjoying the pleasurable feelings and the &quot;one day, I will...&quot; too much to the point that I never go to the gym. I think my brain has learned that I can quell whatever feeling I am having in the moment by daydreaming. It&#x27;s my brain&#x27;s shortcut. It&#x27;s as if my mind say, &quot;Why spend the effort to do something when we can just imagine how it feels and enjoy the reward now?&quot; Like anything in life, the key is balance. However, creating that balance is not easy in my experience.",

So, for some tasks, I would gladly take a quarter of the reward to avoid spending ten times the effort to acquire it. &gt; Not acting on a desire you think of is separate from the idea that people don&#x27;t give their brains a break. I agree and disagree. While there are obvious differences, I do believe not giving one&#x27;s brain a break is partly causative in depleting one&#x27;s desire&#x2F;ability to act.

When I go hiking&#x2F;backpacking, I don&#x27;t listen to music at all, as I enjoy the peacefulness of the forest and the break that my mind gets from the noise of life. I also typically default to paper maps after having done a lot of research via guidebooks, old and new, about where I&#x27;m heading. I&#x27;ll reach for my phone if I really need it, but usually I don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t roll with a GPS track I downloaded from someone&#x27;s past trip. I&#x27;m there to enjoy the environment around me, and that means hearing it, too. Same for driving. Maybe I&#x27;ll use Waze if it&#x27;s somewhere I&#x27;ve never really been before, but typically I&#x27;ll just look it up beforehand and find my way there on my own. When it comes to those navigation choices, wrt both driving and hiking, it gives me a better understanding of the area, and a stronger sense of route options, and therefore a stronger sense of myself being able to find my own way, than if I were to rely on a screen (or Google Maps&#x2F;Waze audio telling me where&#x2F;when to turn and me following blindly).",

A garmin or something would likely be better for this, but I don&#x27;t particularly want to buy one and the phone does a fine job.",

I do active thinking about projects I have, I recapitulate human interactions and reweight my decisions, I decide stuff that is going to happen. Someimes I do nothing, its not like I plan this stuff. I just plan not using any devices. (I also dont listen to music). A friend and me worked for like a year back to back on a project and I like forced him to split work-time and come with me with the dogs. He absolutely loved it and said recently that he still forces himself to take a longer break for walks because that just makes him more productive.",

I would not agree to this however: &gt; It was then up to the reader to decide which of those sites they wanted to visit, With current search engines, Google decides for you (&quot;helped&quot; by SEO experts failing over themselves to rank higher because their revenue directly depends on it). In theory, you could go an read a few dozen pages and decide for yourself. In reality, non-technical users will click on a first link that seems to be related to the question, and that&#x27;s it. Even with AI-based search (or q&#x2F;a instead of search) I think the same will happen. There is and will be a huge reward for gaming the results, be they page links or RAG snippets that rank for a query. I&#x27;ve already seen many SEO shops advertising their strategies to keep the customers&#x27; business relevant in the chatbot area. As this approach becomes more prevalent, you can be sure many smart people will do many experiments to figure out how best to please the new algorithm. In other words, AI-based search is an UX optimization, but doesn&#x27;t address the core problem of how do you decide what content&#x27;s the best, and do that in context of each user, and do that while maximizing the benefit for the user vs profit for the company doing this. So we have two huge hurdles: 1. who will decide what the user wants[0] to see, and how are incentives for that entity aligned with the user&#x27;s 2. how is that entity supposed to find the information needle in the haystack of slop that&#x27;s 90%+ of current web?

    "text": "In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it&#x27;s 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail. It&#x27;s my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren&#x27;t operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.) Lot of preamble to say: no, I don&#x27;t think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.",

The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn’t enough. He was right.&quot; I like how Chandler writing sci-fi sounds exactly like Chandler writing one of his gumshoe stories. It&#x27;s terse and tense and cynical. The protagonist drives a vehicle into some kind of ambush, and everything&#x27;s incredibly snappy (including the scenery). Not at all like the actual sci-fi author who turned the parody into a complete story, and felt compelled to discuss something in the middle of the action, and ruined the pace. I don&#x27;t think &quot;Google&quot; here is a machine or all-knowing entity, sounds more like it&#x27;s just some guy. With prior experience of disintegrating Brylls.",

I listen to a lot of NPR podcasts and contribute to WHYY monthly but I don&#x27;t think i ever tuned into WHYY, i don&#x27;t even know the frequency they use :P Reality is that all media is pretty much toast unless you&#x27;re some big name like the NYT and this is really sad because i really love the NPR podcasts, but not sure how they can survive long term without the local radios.",

I&#x27;m trying to think of unethical things it can do that are not in the realm of &quot;you asked it for that information, just as you would have searched on Google&quot;, but I can only think of things like &quot;how to make a bomb&quot;, suicide related instructions, etc which I would place in the &quot;sharp knife&quot; category.

    "text": "Disagreeing here! I think we often overlook the value of excellent educational materials. Karpathy has truly revitalized the AI field, which is often cluttered with overly complex and dense mathematical descriptions. Take CS 231, for example, which stands as one of Stanford&#x27;s most popular AI&#x2F;ML courses. Think about the number of students who have taken this class from around 2015 to 2017 and have since advanced in AI. It&#x27;s fair to say a good chunk of credit goes back to that course. Instructors who break it down, showing you how straightforward it can be, guiding you through each step, are invaluable. They play a crucial role in lowering the entry barriers into the field. In the long haul, it&#x27;s these newcomers, brought into AI by resources like those created by Karpathy, who will drive some of the most significant breakthroughs. For instance, his &quot;Hacker&#x27;s Guide to Neural Networks,&quot; now almost a decade old, provided me with one of the clearest &#x27;aha&#x27; moments in understanding back-propagation.",

It&#x27;s certainly not a problem with the LEDs themselves, but with the power or control circuitry. But, just like how it&#x27;s rarely the LEDs themselves that have failed when your LED lightbulb stops working, the end result is that it&#x27;s broken anyway and so needs repair. I see more broken LED lights than broken old-style lights, but that may be because there are more of them on the road now. I don&#x27;t know what the percentage failure rate is between the two. Interestingly, years ago when stoplights were being replaced with LED versions, almost all of them would begin exhibiting similar failures within weeks of installation. That seems to have been fixed now -- I rarely see malfunctioning stoplights anymore. So perhaps cars will catch up to that standard.",

Then we were forced to WFH. Now, we&#x27;re being told to do hybrid, but there&#x27;s no peer friendships because it&#x27;s hotdesking, and the senior personnel are no longer nearby (they&#x27;re at home or on a different floor) ... so there&#x27;s no &quot;return&quot;, we&#x27;re not going back to what we had, we don&#x27;t have our own desks anymore. Management acknowledge that office days (we&#x27;re hybrid) will be low in productivity, but no changes to productivity requirements. It&#x27;s all about collaboration, except you&#x27;re next to random people you&#x27;ve never met and you can&#x27;t talk because it&#x27;s open plan and you&#x27;ll disturb everyone.

I mean this is true in the scenario where demand for their skills outstrips the supply of available workers with said skills. In a different scenario, where tech jobs are being reduced across the board (due to return to normal interest rates and VC funding slowing down), such an &quot;aren&#x27;t going back&quot; ultimatum isn&#x27;t necessarily going to be compatible with &quot;I need a job.&quot; And of course, if you believe Microsoft, ChatGPT is going to start eating tech jobs left and right any day now. The economy runs in boom and bust cycles, and the winds are shifting. The tech environment from 2020-2022 was extremely weird, and the balance of power now is shifting back to management. Management knows that (at least some) workers highly value remote work, and they&#x27;re not going to hand that out for free. The only certainty here is change, and as tech workers lose leverage, &quot;remote work&quot; moves from a default assumption to an item that must be negotiated for (perhaps in exchange for some total compensation) - if it&#x27;s available at all.",

No strict work hours but I come anyway, nice to chat with colleagues (and much more productive than those tedious calls or text chats). Also I was already making myself leave home at least daily for physical activity, so if I&#x27;m out why not travel to the office? There&#x27;s a nice coffeeshop near there. Also the chair is comfy enough, desk is adjustable etc. So no, to say it&#x27;s &quot;bullshit and everyone knows it&quot; is just pushing for some agenda. I wish everyone can have their way, if you don&#x27;t want to come to the office then don&#x27;t, employers should make it possible, but don&#x27;t make it sound as if everyone hates it, it&#x27;s just wrong.",

Having an &quot;in-person&quot; setup, where your team is distributed between building locations and remote sites, and you can&#x27;t ever schedule conferences rooms and you are working in a cube-farms&#x2F;open-office sucks.

They have no clue how to lead WFH. They have no clue how to manage WFT. And they&#x27;re not interested in learning new tricks. They simply wield their power and reinstate the status quo. In a word...weak. The RTO v WFH debate (?) is an opportunity in the market. An opportunity where WFH is the new up and coming opportunity. RTO is all but a fax machine.

Workplace independence is what those of us who don&#x27;t want to go back in are looking for, and there&#x27;s room enough for everyone. You can go in, I can stay home, we can work together. The last bit matters, though, because you going in have to be accepting of those of us who don&#x27;t want to. Yeah, you&#x27;re gonna sit on Zoom calls still from the comfort of your cube, but at least at my company, we were doing that on Skype before anyway, we just all forgot. Any office with more than one building, or any company with a tolerant work from home policy, had at least one person not come in at a time, so voice calls were a requirement. It was never not that way, and it won&#x27;t go back to the time before that when absence meant missing things. Make If you want to go back and make us all go with you, now we have a problem.

The reason it isn&#x27;t, for me, is that I&#x27;m usually answering questions about Why we do something, or How something is supposed to work. I&#x27;m usually giving a quick response, with a link to a design, or a code snippet, or a git commit, or a Code Review link, or something online. So I have to provide an online response whether you ask me in person or not. If I&#x27;m in a 1:1, yea I totally agree I&#x27;d rather just talk about career growth and that stuff in person. But.... I mean now we are walking down the already-well-discussed path of Manager&#x2F;IC and how these jobs are just different. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I think this is the experience of many senior developers. [edit] &gt; I twiddled my thumbs waiting for the required SME to come online I mean, this isn&#x27;t an RTO discussion. If your SME is slacking off that is a different problem. Assuming best intentions, you would walk up to that SME&#x27;s desk and there would already be 5 people waiting with a question because the SME can only talk to 1 person at a time. I can slack with several different folks, so long as they can just wait a second while I type. The worst people (so sorry, there are some great TAMs) are the ones who page you as soon as they need something because they don&#x27;t understand you are busy with a different project.",

I will feel more like a wage slave worker bee who has little autonomy over their work, having to regress to the humiliating dynamic of having to ask my boss for &quot;permission&quot; to work from home. As a night owl, I&#x27;ll be forced to conform my sleep schedule to the CEO&#x27;s, and still show up bright and early on days where I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep, and look busy until 5:30pm+ - maybe stretching out work that could&#x27;ve been done in a few hours to an entire work day because when you&#x27;re stuck in an office there&#x27;s little incentive to work faster since you&#x27;re trapped their all day regardless. When I&#x27;m finally sick of it all I&#x27;ll accept the offer for that remote-friendly company that doesn&#x27;t care what time I wake up, what hours I work, or where I work, just that the work I produce is high quality. If I have the flexibility to WFH, not waste hours&#x2F;day commuting, and live wherever makes me happiest (as opposed to the city my company happens to have an office in, which is probably a city like NYC or SF which may not be my preference), then I will be happier with my employment arrangement, more productive, and more loyal. Also I personally find it easier to accomplish deep work when working under my own conditions, as opposed to some open office with no privacy, constant chatter, and the drudgery of wage slaves who clearly don&#x27;t want to be there but have no choice.

In effect, the person walking over is burdening the other party and the organization rather than spend a little more time to craft a question in writing. Weak written communication skills are at the root of why so many organizations are bad at remote work. If oral communications is all that works at your org, then remote is going to be really tough for you (and your inter-office communication is also probably terrible and you should put the whole company in a single building).",

I’ve worked in wildly successful global companies to which I have contributed wildly successful work collaborating with people I have never once met in person, over years of working with them. I am, emphatically, not questioning your perspective, but I have literally never, over 3 decades, found a need for in person collaboration that could not be satisfied electronically. If anything, post-COVID norms such as Zoom&#x2F;Teams replacing conference calls have improved my daily work immeasurably, even with much less shared space work. I actually go to the office a fair amount but, far from a shared collaboration space, it’s largely a refuge for people who specifically want not to be bothered (by the dog, the kids, the neighbor’s leaf blower, etc.).",

    "text": "&gt; Audio calls also still suck. Commercials in the 90s advertised &quot;crystal clear audio quality&quot; - they stopped talking about it but it never materialised. So this is a funny one because its definitely solvable but it&#x27;s kind of a classic principal agent problem. There&#x27;s a number of things that are going into &#x27;clear audio quality&#x27;. 1. Receiver&#x27;s audio output quality - This is rarely if ever the problem. People usually use their speakers&#x2F;headset to listen to stuff besides corporate meetings, so they&#x27;re motivated to have something at least good enough that they can enjoy their music, talk shows, whatever. 2. Bandwidth allocation - This... this really shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but it is because the user isn&#x27;t paying for the bandwidth, whether that&#x27;s classic cellphone calls, Teams voice, whatever. And so its in the company&#x27;s best financial interest to compress the audio as much as is tolerable. This isn&#x27;t really an issue if #3 isn&#x27;t a problem and the user is in a place without too much background noise, but with open-plan offices, it is a problem if there&#x27;s a lot of people talking. 3. User&#x27;s mic quality - So in gaming communities, people will generally tell you if your mic sucks, because you&#x27;re just some random stranger. And if your mic sucks and you want people to listen to you, you will probably buy a good mic eventually, tweak the settings etc. In a business context, my experience has been that the audio quality has to be pretty bad before anyone even says anything to the speaker. And then it&#x27;s up to that person to either try to get it replaced by IT or pay out of pocket for a good quality mic. And this is assuming that they&#x27;re technical enough to be able to pick out a good mic to begin with or even realize that its something they can solve.",

Nearly all of my exciting office &quot;collaborations&quot; end up feeling great then they&#x27;re happening, but in retrospect, almost always fizzle out after a small window of time. I like onsites for the energy and socialization, but even then I always find most of the work happens back in the hotel room at night, and real planning happens after everyone is back at home. I can&#x27;t imagine working that way all the time. Whereas all of my remote collaborations are well documented while they&#x27;re happening. Typically we have some kind of shared note taking, and writing code collaboratively, etc. Doesn&#x27;t feel as social sometimes, but tends to be a much larger impact. Likewise Open Source software has been largely written by remote people since long before the advent of even video conferencing. Git was originally written with the design intention that kernel hackers could work on a plane (per airplane wifi) without requiring a centralized server to communicate with. &gt; Video conf still sucks. It&#x27;s literally the same as 10 years ago. I still marvel at this. I&#x27;ve been working remote for nearly 15 years now and I honestly don&#x27;t feel that video conferencing has improved noticeably.",

But still, on balance it’s good advise. We all tend to lean too far towards respecting ultimatums from people in power (even when it’s harmful for us). We should collectively shift that balance, and move our default more towards being skeptical of someone giving an ultimatum.

    "text": "Relationships, be they personal, business, or otherwise, include dealbreakers. When a dealbreaker arises, there are two ways to handle it: unilaterally end the relation, or present it to the other party. The latter is an ultimatum, there&#x27;s no way around that. Whether or not the ultimatum is reasonable depends entirely on the specifics, especially in the workplace, employers have expectations which they need to have met. It&#x27;s especially distasteful to bake in the assumption that a romantic partner setting conditions to stay in a relationship is automatically being abusive. If someone is presented with an ultimatum to quit problem drinking or lose their partner, which is more likely: that the partner is abusive or that the other partner is an alcoholic? It&#x27;s certainly not automatic that it&#x27;s the former! A policy of never meeting an ultimatum is one way to live your life, I prefer to consider whether the demands are reasonable and proceed on that basis. For me it shows a stronger sense of self worth to consider this kind of thing on the merits, rather than pre-committing to stick to my guns, which is in effect a counter-ultimatum. Sometimes that&#x27;s the right move, sometimes it isn&#x27;t.",

As you say, an ultimatum isn&#x27;t necessarily abusive. We all have things we want in life - and some of them are deal-breakers for a relationship. But if you read the sentence as written, I think it&#x27;s solid advice - don&#x27;t agree to something when someone is leveraging &quot;power&quot; over you if you can avoid it. That is abusive. People who&#x27;ve been in abusive relationships can read the difference between a &quot;this is make-or-break for the life I want, you need to make a choice&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m abusing this situation to make you agree to something you don&#x27;t want to do &#x2F; is bad for you.&quot;",

Everyone works remotely, but once a quarter you find a nice location that is easy for everyone to get to, pay for their flights and hotels (and if you&#x27;re really nice, their family too, or at least child care at home while they are gone), and then have a couple of days of quarterly planning, hacking sprints, and general social activities that don&#x27;t involve alcohol or strenuous physical activity (but if people want to organize that for themselves they are welcome to do so).",

It’s really counterintuitive, as suggested by all the other replies so far, but I really think it’s the best setup: 1. Individuals and teams can work in whatever way is most productive for them. 2. On a day to day basis, everyone who’s in the office is there because they want to be there, not because their boss requires them to be there. Speaking from experience, this leads to way better energy at the office. 3. Yes, you’re restricting hiring to a single geographical area. But for a small startup in a tech hub that’s not an issue, there’s plenty of talent around, you just have to convince them they should work for you. 4. People will want to work for you, because they’ll appreciate not only the flexibility, but the fact that you’re treating them like adults who can manage their own working practices. I’ve told several recruiters this year something to the effect of “I’d only be looking to move for a role with more scope and autonomy, and if I can’t be trusted with a decision as simple as where to work from, this role probably doesn’t offer the level of autonomy I’d be looking for.” At a larger scale you might have to branch out to multiple hubs, but I think having departments or at least functional teams colocated but with flexible work arrangements is a huge advantage over the alternatives.",

The course itself was mostly about how to teach humans to define what they wanted precisely enough to actually ask a computer to do it (utility functions, logic, Baysean mathematics, etc). Neural networks were touched on, of course; but the state of the art at the time was search. Compiler optimization? AI. Map routing? AI. SQL query optimizer? AI. I can&#x27;t find it right now, but there used to be somewhere on the sqlite.org website that describes its query optimizer as an AI. Classically speaking, that&#x27;s 100% correct. Obviously there was always in people&#x27;s minds the idea of AI being AGI; the course also covered Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room argument and so on, &quot;strong AI&quot; vs &quot;weak AI&quot; and so on. But the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence research was nowhere near anything like an AGI.",

    "text": "I can&#x27;t tell if this is just a matter of different assumptions. I think superintelligence is obvious even in principle. I would analogize with some technology like nano-tech. The tech-tree starts with fire, metallurgy, chemistry, atomic physics, solid-state electronics and will eventually get to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomically_precise_manufacturi... There is nothing &quot;in principle&quot; to stop this trend, and even more than that, there is no limitation when constructing arrangements of matter outside physics and knowledge. You could accuse me of technological determinism if you wanted. superintelligence isnt something different than intelligence to me. Its just a transition in the substrate. Intelligence is the emergent capacity of a system to alter its environment to achieve goals. superintelligent systems are those with more capability. the main difference is the magnitude of the ability to correlate the system&#x27;s internal model with external reality and then act on that model to produce low error predictions of the world state. the act-perceive-optimize loop of synthetic minds is unbounded in ways that biological minds are. artificial minds will build larger models of the world that correlate better with reality and they will search-think-tinker with their internal models to better achieve their goals. What could stop this? Sure you can posit an asymphtote. But what if i said the singularity creates minds that are 300 IQ? Smarter than any person would ever be even if trillions of humans were born. What if the number is 3000 IQ? I do think of it as evolution but faster because evolution isn&#x27;t directed, its just global search optimization.

    "text": "I wrote a quick and dirty web app that leverages a multi-step iterative process to generate an article from a single topic prompt. It combines SERP analysis, semantic SEO data from NLTK (summarized and enhanced by GPT), and the language generation capabilities of GPT4. The final articles it generates are informed by an understanding of the content already ranking for the given keyword (ala MarketMuse or Clearscope) and generates a 4,000+ word, well organized article. Here&#x27;s how it works: 1⃣ The script begins by analyzing the SERPs of your chosen topic, summarizing the NLP to gather common themes and important keywords to provide a semantically rich guide to writing a comprehensive outline. 2⃣ It generates an initial outline using #GPT4. The outline is then improved iteratively, incorporating semantic SEO insights from the SERP analysis. 3⃣ The improved outline is used as a guide to create long-form content, again using GPT4. 4⃣ The content is further improved and refined, resulting in a comprehensive, detailed, and SEO-rich long-form article. I&#x27;m super excited about the future of agent like approaches, and while this isnt exactly a full agent, it is using an iterative approach that vastly improves the quality and length of a given article output. If you find it useful, let me know!",

And, at least in the tests I&#x27;ve run (not with the biggest one, but only up to a dozen billion parameters), all the opt models severely underperform with respect to even much smaller models. To the point that the launch of OPT (before BLOOM) was literally advertised as &quot;the biggest OpenSource language model released to date&quot;, because they couldn&#x27;t push on much else. BLOOM goes indeed up to 175B parameters, and is certainly better than OPT. However, at least in my specific tests, it&#x27;s still significantly inferior to OpenAI models, and actually on par with a few smaller models. There&#x27;s also a &quot;newer&quot; fine-tuned model, called BLOOMZ, but at least in my tests it&#x27;s even worse. Of course, that depends a lot on what you ask the model to do... If LLAMA can indeed match OpenAI products, and do so with much fewer parameters, then it would be really great, and I&#x27;d really like to test it. However, even if the weights are now in the wild, using them would be clearly against the user agreement, and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to do that in my work time :-) so let&#x27;s hope Meta will come to sense and release them with a more friendly set of terms...",

ML is just applying the search over the function that will search for the final answer over a dataset (either generated on the fly or prepared beforehand). For neural networks the hypothesis space (all the solutions you are searching through to find the best ones) is the weights for the neural network, and your search strategy&#x2F;optimization is (usually) backpropagation. If you translate the weights to something traversable by other algorithms they could do just &quot;fine&quot; (assuming infinite time and space) in it&#x27;s place. It really opens the mind up for experimentation on every bit of the process.

Then again if HN is what it claims, maybe not?) What makes this place special is there are a wide range of people here interested in many subjects. What I love most is cutting through the bull. I doubt there&#x27;s a person here who doesn&#x27;t know about The Scientific Method, or The Placebo Effect. We don&#x27;t automatically give credit to the wealthy boys unless they did something really spectacular in their lives, and we want to know exactly how much help the wealthy family had in the success. We don&#x27;t let them pontificate ad nausium because they made money. We scrutinize and investigate everyone, and every idea. From the best in class PhDs to lost disenfranchised souls. Everyone has a chance to make their point. Hacker News is by far the best site for technical discussion. (I do spend too much time here. It&#x27;s my fault though. I don&#x27;t have much of a life, and I am lonely. I am looking for new sites besides Reddit. Reddit would be so much better if everyone wasen&#x27;t trying out for a SNL contract.)",

It&#x27;s strange how we can so quickly adjust to holidays from different countries in just a few years -- while forgetting the ones back home so easily. And it&#x27;s not because we were ingrained with them as kids, because while I grew up in Jamaica, I&#x27;ve totally forgotten the holidays there now. I guess the main one is Christmas - it&#x27;s hard to forget because of all the shopping - and that&#x27;s kinda celebrated here in Asia too. Anyway... Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!",

Some compiler optimization was AI. Search was AI. Now, those things are, well, those things. They work. Things are a little different now. The feasibility of neural networks trained up on vast data sets means we have non-human systems with hunches. That is, we have AIs capable of delivering results without explanations. Take a look at Neal Stephenson&#x27;s recent &quot;Fall&quot; for a social network that uses AI to generate &quot;news&quot; stories where the training metric is engagement. The consequence is the construction of an alternate social universe, and the kind of dystopia only Stephenson can dream up. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldcat.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;fall-or-dodge-in-hell&#x2F;oclc&#x2F;11... Human hunches are often accompanied by a sense of ethics. The agricultural savant who sexes hatchling baby chickens knows the success of the farm depends on a low error rate. The judge sentencing a culprit knows the consequence of making mistakes. I wonder how hard it would be to add a sense of ethics to neural network results? Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of managing the error rates. But this article suggests otherwise.",

Nobody is saying you have to have H1 tags to rank well, but it&#x27;s not going to hurt and is likely to help.

    "text": "Well, isn&#x27;t this something. Lots to consider (and I&#x27;m behind on all the comments atm.) I worked in aviation operations for a number of years (prior profession) and lived and breathed UTC. I wrote this then, so it&#x27;s ... from last century. (Not in the wayback machine anywhere. I had to dig it back up.) &gt;&gt;&gt;THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK : EXPLAINED by The AceyMan Most anyone who can read a language (as you are doing now) is familiar with &#x27;time&#x27; and &#x27;timekeeping&#x27;. This short essay hopes to explain the concept of non-local, or universal time, and promote its standardization. Until 1993, the clock that was set as a reference for all local time zones was kept in the United Kingdom. Due to its position at the Greenwich meridian, it was refered to as &#x27;Greenwich Mean Time&#x27;, or GMT. This clock was the world standard for all time zones, and never changes, ie, no savings time, no adjustments, except for accuracy. It is _defined_ as the world standard for time. So, when a nation or geographical area decides what local time is, they still must have a reference to set it against. (Time is relative, remember). GMT is that standard. For example, in the eastern United States, local (non-daylight) time is 5 hours behind GMT. That is to say, if GMT is 1800 hours (and yes, it uses a 24 hour, or &#x27;military&#x27; clock), then US eastern time would be 1300 hours, ie, 1800-500=1300 or 1:00 pm. Now the confusion with local time occurs mainly when either of two things happens. First, when a person moves from time zone to timezone frequently and must make constant calculations to determine what time it &#x27;really&#x27; is, or how long he&#x27;s been awake, driving, burning fuel, running his computer, accruing hours, charging his customers, or any various other important numbers. This is frequent in transportation, especially aviation, where many time zones may be traversed in a short period. Second, when one is working with a worldwide communications system and may be talking with persons outside of your local timezone, sometimes FAR OUTSIDE your local time zone. In this case, GMT is especially useful, because by referring to GMT, one can still know what time that person is referring to, without asking where he is. For example, if you know what GMT is, and I know what GMT is, and I say, &quot;I have to leave to go to a meeting at 1400 GMT&quot;, then the other person knows when that person will be leaving. S&#x2F;he won’t have to ask &quot;well, what&#x27;s your local time now, so I can figure out how long it is before you go&quot;. GMT spares all parties from such time-consuming calculations. GMT should, and this author hopes WILL BE the clock for the world in the near future, as it should be. We owe the widespread use of global communications, particularly the Internet, for this expectation. ### I stand by most of that now (but I would do at least one rewrite says older me, heh). Doing time sums and differences on the fly across multiple time zones is loco. For both fuel and personnel planning. It&#x27;s not just weather reports and ETD&#x2F;ETA times. We are crunching time ALL time in air ops, and you have to have a pinned baseline. I think the time has long past to go unified. Then the only question you have to ask someone is &quot;What&#x27;s your UTC offset?&quot; E.g., in your .plan file or S4B header text. Problem handled. &#x2F;Acey [edit: unix errata]",

    "text": "Making your reports 2x as productive is far more expansive (and less visible) than just ensuring they&#x27;re working on stuff 2x as important or doing 2x as much work. Think of software for a moment. Has there every been a library, language, framework, etc that you absolutely love to use? The API is just right, the framework is the perfect level of opinionated vs. not opinionated, it just gets out of your way and lets you accomplish what you want, it&#x27;s consistently reliable, it has fantastic backwards compatibility, it&#x27;s error handling semantics are clear and the right level of verboseness, the internals are so well architected that it&#x27;s also incredibly performant, etc. It&#x27;s just such a pleasure to work with . It&#x27;s always just what you need, right when you need it, exactly how you needed it. A company is a system, just like software. And a team is a submodule within that system. A 2x manager is the person that is able to make (and maintains) their team into the type of beloved system I mentioned above. How they do that is dependent on their expertise at comprehending, navigating, and influencing the larger system, and shaping their team to be precisely what that larger environment needs. As hard as it is to do the above, it&#x27;s really, really easy for a 0.1x manager to destroy that type of system&#x2F;team. A few breaking API changes (&quot;my team no longer handles those types of request you&#x27;ve been giving my team for years&quot; vs &quot;I&#x27;ve spoken with team x and it turns out they&#x27;re more appropriately staffed to complete that work. Don&#x27;t worry though, I&#x27;ve got a change management process in place and will ensure the handoff is seamless for you&quot;, refactoring some internal code that kills performance (i.e. losing important ICs without any risk mitigation&#x2F;change management in place), etc can all tank the goodwill and community adoption of that once beloved system. I switch between being an IC, a purely people manager, a functional manager (i.e. a team lead with people management and hiring&#x2F;firing authority), and a &quot;manager&quot; (that&#x27;s effectively an IC with a manager title so I have the organizational authority to execute the type of work I was doing). If you&#x27;ve never been a manager before, let me tell you: doing that shit right is exhausting. The biggest difference between being an IC and being a manager is that, as an IC, I&#x27;m able to ignore 90% of the bullshit around me and focus on my work. As a manager (whether doing IC work or purely people-managing), I can&#x27;t ever tune out that organizational noise&#x2F;bullshit&#x2F;dysfunction&#x2F;needs, because the more in tune I am with that the more likely that I can position my team to support the company, and in doing so ensure the peace of my team. It&#x27;s hard to image what a 2x manager is, because there&#x27;s no single way to define one. But as an IC, having (or losing) a 2x manager will have a noticeable impact on you and your team&#x27;s productivity over time, in any of a dozen or so different ways.",

Consider the following statements: 1) I&#x27;m looking for something specific. 2) I&#x27;d rather not be surprised right now. 3) I&#x27;d like to get through the search&#x2F;index as fast as possible to get where I&#x27;m going. The above are user-voiced versions of principles that drive traditional UI, and are absolutely better met by that optimization process. AI-driven search and feeds were exciting because they were the first method that captured use cases where users wouldn&#x27;t make those statements: fuzzy queries about general interests, the desire for diversions &quot;curated&quot; by your own social group, and search&#x2F;feed review as itself as an entertaining experience. Then, it turned out that these unexplored use cases were actually the giant, underwater part of the iceburg of what people wanted from information systems. The growth and attention capture you can drive from meeting those cases is not only massive, it sucks the oxygen out of traditional value propositions by out-competing for the same attention. I think a return to traditional &quot;capture and facilitate intent&quot; UI (or even better a synthesis of the two!) will only be driven by users finding a way to explicitly value their own clarity of attention. We see signs of this in everything from ad blockers to focus-oriented browser plug-ins, but I think we&#x27;re still missing the FOMO-conquering expression of this value proposition that becomes a competitive product.",

Then the government does more bad stuff. More are frustrated, only a few speak out. And on, and on, for decades. It seems like nothing will ever change. And one day &quot;something happens&quot; that makes all of that frustration come up, and the people are furious like nothing else, and you may even see riots and whatnot. And the people on the sidelines, who have no clue about how life was in that country wonder &quot;why would people be so violent, and destroy things?! It doesn&#x27;t make sense!&quot; Yes, it does make sense. It&#x27;s just not pretty . And yes, it will happen to Google, too. I&#x27;ve tried to warn them and other tech companies many times in the past on HN, that they can&#x27;t just screw over their users and piss them off, thinking only a few spoke out, so it must not be such a big deal the evil thing they&#x27;ve just done. Many more people are usually frustrated about that thing, but they usually keep that frustration inside because they would like to continue using Google. So, yes. Google is definitely next. Just maybe not tomorrow, or next year. Maybe in a few years. My guess is it will be something around how they use their AI, especially now that they&#x27;ve become a war contractor. Maybe they&#x27;ll sell their AI tech to US law enforcement to target American citizens in various ways. It&#x27;s probably inevitable. A Facebook exodus was never going to be linear . It will be drastic , and it will &quot;surprise&quot; people, even at the company, just as this surprises you now (although I wouldn&#x27;t say that exodus will happen now , but this is definitely a one of the big final steps before that exodus, at the very least).",

When I play with ideas I just put a &#x27;x&#x27; on the G line with a superscript 4 next to it. Music theory could be taught in a way so that students learnt to find the G as a matter of course. But for some reason we&#x27;ve been beaten into thinking in terms of these two clefs. It might have something to do with the way a conductor reads full-score. With typesetting technology it should be mess important to have conductor and accompanist on the same clef. We&#x27;re not far from a point where everything could move to e-ink. It&#x27;ll probably take another century for music libraries to have been completely moved to digital.",

    "text": "Sure ! Karl Marx originally explained the idea quite well. Wages in a real economy is the real driver for demand. The capitalist yearning to drive down wages and cost as much as they can. That is how the system was designed ! The end result of thus maximum capital accumulation is a Commodification of labour. What does that mean ? It means that once wages are pushed down enough - there is no room for labour to increase demand and thus generate growth ( the thing that drives capitalism ). Once you commodity labour then the demand side of your market collapses. -------------------------------------------------- This was what essentially what happened prior to the great depression and what happened ever since 2008. I know people in silicon valley live in a bubble, but if you go outside you will see that the world is burning. The reason why tech engineers are being paid 500K is not because of some inherit huge contribution to society but because huge accumulated capital is looking for yield. ------------------------------------------------------ The way historically this inherient end state of capitalism was solved was through war ( it doesn&#x27;t have to be ) War de-commodifcation labour by massively increasing its demand. It happened during WW-2, vietnam war, iraq war ( after the tech bubble burst ) --------------------------------------------------------- One way to solve the european debt crisis for example would be massively start spending. Imagine a massive investment to completely reform europe into green energy. There is however no political will to pursue this. --------------------------------------------------------- The Chinese however understand this very well, their leaders are well versed with karl marx&#x27;s study on capitalism - unlike in the west where neo-classic liberalism has corrupted the field of economics to such a degree that we cannot even openly talk about marx&#x27;s analysis. ---------------------------------------------------------- For example the Chinese had 0 miles of high speed trains in 2009. Now they have 6000 miles worth of it ! They spend more cement in a year then america did in 100 ! They have more green energy then then both US and europe combined - even though they had no technological expertise until recently. The Chinese also are spending a lot on their military but its a small part. They know that it can bankrupt a society. Their most astounding new initiative is to provide free universal healthcare to 1.4 billion people ! While we in the west cannot even get out act together to solve the greece&#x27;s debt problem. We are driving up growth by inflating huge tech and asset bubble in hope of driving up demand since the government is completely paralysed to act in a decisive way.",

    "text": "It&#x27;s hard to be sure why exactly shared libraries and dynamic linking appeared. Your explanation about reducing file size for smaller HDD and RAM footprint is probably one of the reasons, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the only one - I don&#x27;t remember many shared libraries from MSDOS days (where with 2MB of RAM and 40MB of HDD, storage was really scarce). In fact - I don&#x27;t remember any libraries! To run Doom you just borrowed the floppies from a friend and it would 100% work. The same for Warcraft 1. I believe it&#x27;s more similar to Database Normalization from RDBMS world than to anything else. And the most important objective of Database Normalization is considered &quot;Freeing the database of modification anomalies&quot;. My own experience with shared libraries is pretty positive. I have fixed OpenSSL vulnerabilities many times by just updating the OpenSSL library and restarting all services. Compared to my own experience with docker where after waiting for a few weeks I had to change my base images (as nobody was updating them) updating just a single shared library and having the vulnerability fixed is way easier! This, of course, is true if those who maintain the software you use do care about backwards compatibility (which tends to be true for the &quot;boring&quot; stuff and false for the stuff considered &quot;cool&quot; - looking at you nodejs library developers who break my build at least once a month).",

    "text": "&gt; This is clearly wrong - I demonstrated a stupidly simple alternate theory which disagrees with the consensus, but still lacks constant power shifts. Your theory didn&#x27;t even explain the data (in the software industry), and had nothing to say about power. Basically, it can comfortably exist beside the consensus theory as a second-order effect (and the data actually looks like that is probably the case, explaining representation differences of up to 2:1). &gt; So why cling to that theory, rather than, say, my theory of p=A - B x math_content + second_order_corrections? Two reasons: 1. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the anomalous software industry (neither the very low participation nor the sudden change) while the consensus theory does, and 2. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the lack of representation (and possible correction after well-documented struggles) in fields of high prestige and little math (such as law, medicine and politics). In all those fields: law, medicine, politics and software, women participation was (or is) far lower than 30%. It was&#x2F;is lower than 20%. You might think that singling out software is uninteresting from a statistical perspective, as in Scott Alexander&#x27;s regression it was just a single (outlier) data point, but in fact, the software industry is larger than all &quot;heavy math content&quot; professions combined, and holds more power in today&#x27;s society. &gt; My theory predicts more things (e.g., it predicts % women in academia, % women in finance, % women in tech vs non-tech roles) and is vastly simpler. How is that not a win? Because it predicts fewer things, and not even what you claim it does. At best, it predicts fewer women than men in certain subjects, but that&#x27;s it. However, we see that while the binary relation &quot;fewer&quot; may remain, how much fewer decreases over time. Second, it only holds (even as a binary prediction) when you look at the past few decades -- far too short to look at social change -- which means it does not explain the exclusion of women from law, medicine and politics. Third, it does not explain the way-too-low representation in CS, nor the drop in participation. The consensus theory explains all of it, for any time duration. It even explains interesting shifts we see in, say, education (more women as prestige drops, while in CS fewer women as prestige rises). Yes, it&#x27;s more complicated, but fits reality better, plus it&#x27;s supported by lots and lots of data.",

    "text": "I do deny that there are rising tensions. However, before I continue, I would like to highlight that those numbers are coming from a non-gov that have a pretty infamous record, as well as strong ties with Islam fundamentalism circles. - Their definition of &quot;hate-crime&quot; is pretty blurry. For example, in 2007 a civil employee asked a muslim woman who was fully veiled to take off her niqab in order to verify her identity. This was considered a &quot;hate crime&quot;. There is a plethora of similar stories. - They do not disclose their methodology or data. - They hold some seriously backward views on society. For example, they consider any feminist organization to be &quot;islamophobic&quot; de facto. There have been plenty of controversies raised by their leadership for being openly antisemite. Accusing the government &quot;of favoring the jews&quot;. If you read french, more at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Collectif_contre_l%27islamopho... , there has been some very interesting analysis made by investigation journalist from Le Monde (left) as well. ===== Now, even ignoring the fact that those numbers are almost certainly made up. I do not think you can really generalize that to the whole country. It is really confusing for an outsider, but refugees, educated muslims and muslims living in the suburbs are pretty much very distinct groups in the eyes of most people. No one is pissed at someone for being a muslim, what generates anger and frustration are the ones who: - commit crimes - try to pull their religion on everyone else. I would not say that France is openly against muslims. There isn&#x27;t one muslim community. Plenty of people from north-african ancestry, who happen to have been raised by a muslim family are doing just fine. I have friends, lived in a nice neighborhood in Paris. I was invited by my neighbors, and so on. I am now living in SF, it&#x27;s a bit different although I haven&#x27;t had any major issues. I got some stares from time to time, but it&#x27;s probably because I walk funny.",

I would not call France &quot;anti-Muslim&quot;, especially when 10% of the population is of Arabic descent, and Muslim. Seriously, the US has barely 1% of its population that is muslim.

I guess it is in some ways similar to the prejudices that the other sexes experience, and maybe fundamentally its sourced from the same conscious&#x2F;subconscious desire to control the way other people live their lives, regardless of differences&#x2F;similarities between the relevant parties.

    "text": "USENET, was in my opinion, one of the best features&#x2F;protocol of the initial internet. I loved USENET ever since I discovered it (91&#x2F;92) and I still use today a news reader through gmane, looking down at forums (just like this one) like a sad evolution. Having an USENET server provided by your ISP used to be a standard part of the package. They would probably not carry alt.bin, but in the end it didn&#x27;t matter. A truly P2P, open , messaging network, of the likes that you&#x27;ll never see developed again due to commercial exploitation. USENET had &quot;flaws&quot;, but honestly they&#x27;re minor. The store and forward protocol required quite some disk space at the time. This resulted in several nodes to drop bin&#x2F;alt.bin from the network (which in my opinion was always a hack providing nothing really useful, with yencoding&#x2F;par and the like). But by today standards, you could probably run a node carrying the entire network with just maybe a bit more than regular consumer hardware, since it&#x27;s just text in the end, and the server is very simple: I used to run one server locally just for me. How big a today&#x27;s network could be? See for yourself: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gmane.org&#x2F;stats.php Or: not big for any ISP to carry in full with just one sysadmin. The network relied on &quot;control&quot; messages to create&#x2F;delete groups automatically (as opposed to manual subscription), which due to the lack of authentication&#x2F;encryption in the protocol, were very easy to spoof. A gpg-signing mechanism was later put into place, so that nodes peering with each other could establish a chain of trust by themselves. This was pretty nice in retrospect (and awesome by today standards), but the main problem is that creating new groups was a slow and painful approval-based process: people often wanted small groups just for themselves, and mailing lists offered the &quot;same&quot; without any approval required. Having a large open network started to become a big attractor for SPAM, and managing SPAM in a P2P network without authentication is a harder problem to solve than a locally managed mailing list. For the same reason, trolls could be a nuisance at time. Some people claim that USENET became 1) too big 2) a receptacle for copyright infringement. Both claims are bullshit: by excluding binary groups (which was ubiquitous by 91&#x2F;92 when I joined already), the network started in a consistent volume decline already in the late 90ies, so it cannot be that hosting a node in 1998 became impossible in 2005. Here&#x27;s what happened: running a local server became so easy and cheap, that running mailing list offered local control and almost zero overhead. People that had niche groups started to create mailing lists with open access, and people migrated in flock. Why share your discussions in comp.programming.functional where you could create a mailing list just for your new fancy language? (it&#x27;s pretty sad, because I loved the breadth of the discussions). Discussions on general groups became less frequent as most of the interesting ones were on dedicated mailing lists. The trend worsened significantly as forums started to appear, which lowered the barrier to entry to people that didn&#x27;t know how to use a mail client properly. The sad truth is that now most of the general discussions aren&#x27;t openly shared anymore, and happen either on local websites (like this) or local mailing lists. I&#x27;ve been using gmane.org to subscribe all open-access lists that I ever participated into. Most of the time, the list I&#x27;m looking for is already there. In a certain sense, gmane.org offers the best of NNTP with the best of mailing lists: you can create your own lists without approval processes, and you can read any other list without having 1) to subscribe directly 2) having to store messages locally 3) see instantly the archive [as far as retention goes]. The mailing list administrator has still ultimate veto on what goes on the list, so that local authority is never undermined. On the other hand, NNTP clients are built to read massive volumes of messages, that would make reading reddit a breeze. What gmane.org lacks though is the peering. One of the central NNTP features of the time was definitely killed.",

I am not sure where you&#x27;re going with this, but you can&#x27;t make such a comparison at a given moment in time. The reason is that struggles usually follow power, and so it is likely that at any point in time, a marginalized group would concentrate its efforts to penetrate positions that imbue power. As the power structure shifts, so does the struggle. You can&#x27;t equate professions that hold different amounts of power at different times. Certainly up until some decades ago, law and medicine carried much more prestige and influence -- and hence, power -- than math and the physical sciences. In fact, software&#x27;s gain of prestige correlates quite well with the drop in women participation. It is quite anomalous in that the existence of the field long predated its power. Law and medicine, OTOH, are professions that have been seats of power for almost a millennium. A model that correlates low female participation with high power -- and later, increased participation after a struggle -- predicts both observations. It is not such a surprising or sophisticated theory; historians have seen this pattern so often that it is almost banal. This pattern is so regular, that it&#x27;s relatively easy for us to predict the future: fifty years from now, assuming the power wielded by software remains high, women participation will equal men&#x27;s, and it will be hard for people to believe that that hasn&#x27;t always been the case. Unfortunately, even though the result of the fight is certain, we still need to fight it. That is the price history exacts from us.",

Mirror for the ctrl+f folks ---------------------------------- Windows 10&#x27;s New Feature Steals Your Internet Bandwidth A couple of days ago I discussed a number of privacy and other concerns with Microsoft&#x27;s new Windows 10, made available as a free upgrade for many existing MS users: Windows 10: A Potential Privacy Mess, and Worse: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lauren.vortex.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;001115.html The situation has only been getting worse since then. For example, it&#x27;s been noted that the Win10 setup sequence is rigged to try fool users into switching to an MS browser, irrespective of their browser settings before they started the upgrade: Mozilla isn’t happy with Microsoft for changing how users change the default web browser in Windows 10: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft-news.com&#x2F;mozilla-isnt-happy-with-microsoft-... Pretty bad. But we have even lower to go, as we&#x27;ve seen that by default, Windows 10 actually steals bandwidth from your ISP connection so that Microsoft can use your computer, and your connection, to send MS updates to their other customers. Huh? Say what? Yep. It&#x27;s a devious little feature called Windows Update Delivery Optimization. It&#x27;s enabled by default. For Enterprise and Education users, it operates over the local LAN. For ordinary Home type users, Microsoft can send their data update goodies to potentially any PC on the global Internet -- from your PC, over your Internet connection. On your dime. We could get into the pros and cons of local updates being staged between local machines on a LAN as opposed to the outside Internet. But as soon as MS decided that it&#x27;s A-OK for them to use my Internet connection to cut down on their bandwidth costs serving their other customers -- without asking me for my specific permission first -- the situation blows into the red zone immediately. Microsoft makes the predictable excuses about this high-tech thievery. There&#x27;s a way you can turn it off. Yeah, buried down deep in the settings, assuming you even know about it in the first place. MS claims they only use your connection when it&#x27;s &quot;idle&quot; by their definitions. Thanks a bunch. Oh yes, and (how generous of them!) Microsoft notes that they won&#x27;t steal bandwidth this way from &quot;metered&quot; connections. But here&#x27;s the catch -- you have to manually indicate that a connection shouldn&#x27;t be used for MS&#x27; update delivery scheme. Otherwise, Microsoft has no way to know if (for example) you&#x27;re paying by the gigabyte or have a low bandwidth cap. Above all, the sheer arrogance of Microsoft to enable this bandwidth theft by default is stunning. I don&#x27;t care if they want to move 1K or 1gig to their other happy users, I want to damn well be asked permission first! Obviously, this general category of peer-to-peer data transfer is used on the Net in other contexts, such as torrents for example -- but that&#x27;s something you do voluntarily, of your own volition. Comcast uses the bandwidth of many Comcast users to turn modems in people&#x27;s homes into public Wi-Fi access points. This has been highly controversial, but at least Comcast is typically doing it over modems they supplied, and has claimed that they over-provision the connection speeds to take this into account -- and don&#x27;t apply that public usage against home users&#x27; bandwidth caps. But Microsoft didn&#x27;t even bother with such rationalizations. They simply said in essence: &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got bandwidth, so we&#x27;re gonna use it however we please unless you tell us differently. Suckers!&quot; If you&#x27;re running Windows 10, you may want to terminate this travesty. The settings you need are buried down in: START-&gt;Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security-&gt;Windows Update-&gt;Advanced options, under: Choose how updates are delivered. It&#x27;s worth noting at this point that if Google had tried a stupid stunt like this, there would likely already be EU commissioners running through the streets of Brussels hoisting pitchforks and flaming torches, all yelling for Google&#x27;s blood. For a while there, it was starting to look like there indeed was a new kind of Microsoft coming into view, one that had evolved beyond the hubris that had so long been Microsoft&#x27;s single most defining characteristic. As we can see, any such hopes are now ... Gone with the Win10. --Lauren-- I have consulted to Google, but I am not currently doing so. All opinions expressed here are mine alone.",

Lots of real-world samples follow the normal distribution, and anything that does should look roughly like that sim. So there&#x27;s no real need to use random numbers, but it&#x27;s a very quick way of me getting data that looks like real data and I know I&#x27;ve got the standard deviation &amp; mean correct and that there should be no anomalies. My sim can only show one side of the story though, it can&#x27;t show how often real issues are picked up. For that, we&#x27;d probably want to look at real-world data and investigate each reported issue to see what proportion are important (and then possibly try and see how many were missed).",

    "text": "I&#x27;m really just tripping on nostalgia right now but fuck it someone might appreciate these details so I&#x27;m going to continue. I also remember playing so many good stuff on the Ti-83. We used to download Bubble bobble and even 3d wolfenstein and just slack off. Students did cheat using the Ti-83 by putting formulas and cheat notes. I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t ban it. It was expensive at the time too and I lost or broke mine twice. I&#x27;m not sure if all Canadian high schools were like ours but we had dedicated courses for learning everything from Qbasic to Maya. I was mad jealous of kids that were creating crazy 3d animations with 3ds max but the class was always filled very fast :(. Had I learned the stuff I might have become a computer graphics artist or something in that area. The course I took taught Visual Basic and then QBasic towards the end (I was like dayum I already know this at age 10, let me play web games while teacher is not looking). At lunch time computer graphics lab hosted Counter Strike (1.3 back then) where you paid a dollar to play for 45 minutes and sometimes after school it would go until for several hours. Like jam packed with 20 people screaming and shouting when somebody got knifed. You couldn&#x27;t curse tho because the instructor was a hard ass and kicked people out for typing swear words in the chat. Damn, we even had Battlefield 1942 tournaments. Ironically, being in a poorer school meant ton of corporate endorsements and goodies (free Vancouver Grizzlies tickets &amp; free lunch). During the mid 90s when I was in elementary school, our school had everything from Apple II to Imac. Like almost every Mac from different timeline. One of my favorite was a black &amp; white tiny monitor Apple that had Hypercard on it and I used to create something like dragonball Z stick figure animation (obviously inspired by stickdeath.com) on it. Fuck those were good times especially since I didn&#x27;t have a computer back then and the school provided all these things. In grade 6, our teacher was super supportive of us using technology (he was into tech, even bought a monochrome projector off ebay so he could teach material from the computer). Looking back I can see how fortunate it was to have experienced all these things. I was especially fond of playing games like Lode Runner and Lemonade Stand on the Apple II. Pretty much all of my recess and lunchtime was spent on figuring out 1) find games in dusty bins in school gym 2) figure out how to run it. Our school used to host Zip Zap Map Canada (tetris meets geography) tournaments. At home my dad taught me how to create my own website (so 1997 or 1998) using Netscape Composer (on win 95 or 98) and uploading it to a free host. Used to brag about it and impressed my teacher a lot. I picked up a book on HTML for dummies from the library and started reading about Javascript and Java but these books were in Korean and I had a tough time. Eventually geocities came along and it was day dreaming about making a popular website ( never happened :( ). During this time, we got fresh new iMacs and it was off to the races to find games to run on it, Bugdom, Nanosaur, Sim City Classic &amp; 2000, weird game where you walk around a dungeon and kill monsters and level up. We were also trying to run some weird emulation that supposedly allowed us to play windows games but at super low fps. Everything was going good until one day thieves came in stole all 6~10 iMacs from our classroom. It was shitty but it was also a shitty neighborhood (think Compton without any rap song about it). My grade 6 teacher was really crushed. We got another batch of iMacs and this time we had cables to hold down the iMacs in case someone tried to jack it again and they came in with cable cutters and made off with it AGAIN. Finally they created a dedicated iMac lab on the second floor classroom where thieves couldn&#x27;t break into. Quite a long thread stemming from BASIC lol.",

    "text": "The World Anti-Doping Agency constantly update their list of prohibited substances and develop new tests on a proactive basis. FG-4592 (and a number of similar compounds) have been on the prohibited list since the beginning of 2015. The list can be seen at the list below, and it is extremely comprehensive. Several other substances are not currently prohibited, but are monitored for their possible use as performance enhancing drugs. Alongside track and field athletes, cyclists are the most tested athletes in any sport, and are subject to three core testing regimes. Firstly, cyclists are subject to in-competition testing. The winner of any race (or the stage of a race) and a random sample of other riders will be subject to blood or urine tests. Secondly, the whereabouts program requires cyclists to notify the authorities of their location every day to facilitate out-of-competition testing. Athletes are randomly sampled, with extra scrutiny paid to the strongest performers. Thirdly, the biological passport scheme creates a long-term profile of a rider&#x27;s physiology, to track changes in markers like testosterone&#x2F;epitestosterone ratio and hematocrit that may indicate the use of performance enhancing drugs or methods. A sudden change in any of these markers or deviation outside normal ranges is grounds for sanctioning. In all tests, two samples are taken to safeguard against anomalous measurements or failures in the chain of custody. A portion of both samples is stored indefinitely, to facilitate retroactive testing if new drugs or methods are discovered. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;files&#x2F;wada...",

Generally conductors have something called the &#x27;skin&#x27; effect, which is that as they conduct the electrons move along the outer surface. So the skysphere&#x27;s outer surface forms a ring where the current will move out to the edge, and then back to the center before going into the ground (or more literally coming from the ground but that is not important here). The change in current in the outer rings will create a magnetic pulse inside the ring that is proportional to the change in current, per Ampere&#x27;s law. And for conductors that are inside the sphere part, they will experience a very large change in magnetic flux, which will then induce an electric current in any conductors they have inside of them. It is entirely possible that every piece of electronic equipment inside the sphere will be destroyed by the resulting EMP. Or simply magnetized. But I&#x27;d really want to compute flux lines based on the lightning hitting the top, splitting down for four &#x27;rings&#x27; (Kirkoff&#x27;s law) and then going on down via the center into the earth.",

When this happens find myself daydreaming or finding other things to do that are not work related. The real problem comes though at about 10-11pm and I get a huge burst of energy and focus to start working. I am left with a choice to stay up later and get work done, or go to bed and wake up earlier to catch up on work I missed. If I do decide to go to bed I will lay there for an hour or so just thinking about work and what I need to get done. With that said, last year I was talking to my doctor about it at my annual physical. He suggested I exercise more often. So for about the last 6-7 months I have made a conscious effort that whenever I feel like I am starting to struggle I will go out for at least a 30 minute walk. I usually end up taking about 4-5 a day. There is definitely a direct correlation between the amount I walk and my productivity. And I am starting to sleep a whole lot better at night. Another thing that has helped me is I stopped drinking soda and now only drink water (or coffee).",

The academic view seems that things weren&#x27;t that awful until 1931, when a large Austrian bank failed (Google Creditanstalt), which triggered a wave of global bank failures [1]. The resulting lack of credit was the cause that made the depression Great. When Creditanstalt went down, Dow was off ~50% from its 1929 high, which still happens every now and then. We went through a similar decline during the 2007-08 financial crisis and came out all right thanks to aggressive and globally organized central bank activity. Unfortunately such an organized response didn&#x27;t happen in the 1930s so the economies kept contracting, and the Dow eventually ended up losing 90%.

First of all development of Ares has only recently been reinvigorated by LG devoting assets to the project which HP had taken a dump on when they pretty much gave up on WebOS. EnyoJS is rock-star tech that rock-stars refuse to look at close enough to realize it is what facebook wants react to be - but 10 years ago, and is now the only truly platform independent JS framework. Much work has been done by the LG designers as far as UI (I have followed their often ignored progress very closely of late) and the architecture of Enyo. It is commonly misunderstood due to media sensationalism that LG &quot;aquired&quot; WebOS and it&#x27;s goodies - NO NO NO - what they did is &quot;aquired&quot; the rights to utilize WebOS, along with the rights to own HP&#x27;s nifty little office building in San Francisco (to house LG&#x27;s nifty designers and devs) all under the agreement that they would pay an outrageous amount of money for these nifty items, and furthermore, that LG would slave away at WebOS&#x2F;Enyo so that HP doesn&#x27;t have to, all the while so that HP can benefit from the fruits since HP still owns WebOS&#x2F;Enyo and friends.

Why? That&#x27;s not the thing we should be worried about, or at least that&#x27;s the point I got from the article. The thing we should be worried about is the way machine learning is applied in the here-and-now: the ethics of big data social networks, the robustness of complex (API-driven) systems, and so on. I fully agree that these issues are much more pressing and worrying than some emergent super-intelligence. But I thought the article was weak in its discussion of dreams, creativity, and linear &quot;flat data&quot;. It links to a June 2015 popular mechanics article about applying a genetic search optimization algorithm to discover gene regulatory networks, downplaying it as not-true-intelligence. But it does not mention deep neural networks and their higher-dimensional abstractions, particularly the psychedelic &quot;inception&quot; images. The author also mentions &quot;linear reasoning&quot;, and says he expects we&#x27;ll learn more about intelligence from stem cell and Alzheimer&#x27;s research, and the &quot;tissues surrounding neurons, and the roles they play in contextual regulation.&quot; As if to set up some dichotomy between machine and biological intelligence. But what about deep neural networks?? I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect the author&#x27;s arguments, but I&#x27;d like to see it discussed.",

    "text": "The standard example of unexpected esoteric physic application is the Special and General Relativity corrections of the GPS. 100 years ago nobody thought that we would ever use that small correction or that everybody would have a special-and-general-aware device in the pocket. Another cool application is the superconductors in the NMR devices. They can see what is inside your head and even do something equivalent to a chemical analysis (with NRM spectroscopy) without opening it. The first superconductors experiments used Helium at 4K, so they were only a laboratory curiosity. For everyday use, I like the giant magnetoresistance. This is my favorite case to explain that strange quantum effects have real world direct applications. Just start talking about the spin in electrons. Then explain that some magnetic conductors have a different value of the current with spin up and the currents with spin down. Then add the sandwich with non-magnetic conductors. At this moment it looks like a weird laboratory experiment. Then suddenly explain how it is used in hard disks heads: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giant_magnetoresistance",

    "text": "I&#x27;m confused as to why you would think about soldering a crimped connection Because most crimped connections (at least in the hobbyist&#x2F;DIY world) are crap . So after crimping, the only way they hold together is with solder. There are no applications where this is better. Every connector manufacturer I know recommends against doing it. You can get away with doing it if you support the soldered end against vibration, but you should do that anyway. It&#x27;s really a training issue. People haven&#x27;t been taught better and there is a lot of bad advice floating around hobbyist forums. I have only been using good crimping tools for the last few years since I started making a product with a 50-conductor harness. Until I spent $200 on a crimping tool and took the time to research how to make good crimps (Molex has an excellent document), I never realized how they were supposed to look. Now most of my tools are used, purchased at auctions of dead companies, but I have $400 crimping tools I paid pennies on the dollar for. Even so, I normally farm out crimping to a company that does it with automated machinery, better and faster than I can do by hand.",

I was lucky I that I came out with absolutely decent GCSEs (mostly As and Bs) but unlucky in that I felt shame and now defeat that I could have done much, much better.

    "text": "Great points and great blog too. Paradoxically I think what&#x27;s missing is more manned space exploration - people have a genuine interest in seeing other planets and knowing about space in general, but this interest is tempered by the painful awareness that that we will never get to visit them, so that it&#x27;s like being on an island with a tall tower and a great telescope (through which we can see enticing other places) but no way of building a boat. Of course going into space is so expensive and so few of us would make the cut as astronauts that hardly anyone realistically expects to become a space explorer, but we would like to live vicariously through other space explorers, but this isn&#x27;t possible if our explorers never go anywhere. I think the reason people get so wrapped up in the story of the Mars rovers and the Rosetta&#x2F;Philae mission was that those probes are the most relateable things since people walked on the Moon in the 1970s. Really, I think we should be doing manned Moon missions regularly. People point out that there&#x27;s nothing on the Moon that we want, which is sort of true (although we&#x27;ve learned so much since the last time we went that we should reconsider that angle) but that&#x27;s a dreadfully consumerist mindset. The Moon is a (relatively) accessible destination that we could use as a proving ground for interplanetary exploration techniques. But more importantly, making regular visits or having a permanent outpost there gives people something to project their imaginations onto (including their political and technological imagination). I have a small collection of old newspapers and my favorite is one published the day after the first Moon landing with the simple headline &#x27;Men on Moon&#x27;. Reading it still gives me a shiver of excitement, followed by disappointment that we abandoned Moon exploration by the mid 1970s. One often-forgotten detail of the Moon landing was that at the time there was a Russian observer spacecraft orbiting the Moon, and it dropped down to within 10 miles of the surface at the time of the landing (presumably to observe what the Americans were up to). I saw Neil DeGrasse Tyson on Charlie Rose last week and he was joking that his favorite daydream is meeting the Chinese President at a conference and persuading him to leak a fake memo saying China aims to land a man on Mars, which would galvanize the American body politic back into serious investment in space. Sad but true.",

    "text": "Oh goodie, I love these questions. I&#x27;m going to assume the following is true about you: 1. You can translate someone&#x27;s desires for a product into a software spec. 2. You can translate a spec into a real, working piece of software by programming it using your favorite languages and tech stack. 3. You can do the above in a reasonable amount of time, reliably and consistently, and follow a project deadline with milestones without too much supervision. 4. Your friend is asking for this because he wants to market it as part of a product or service. Great! If you want to be fair to him and give him &quot;mate&#x27;s rates&quot; then charge him $2000 per week. Why $2000 per week? Here is the logical progression: 1. You have the aforementioned, assumed skills (which I am deducing from you being a developer of 3 - 4 years) that make you very valuable. 2. Your floor for making an iOS app for a client would be $5000 per week. Why? Because it&#x27;s mostly arbitrary and it&#x27;s what the market would pay, and I assure you the market would bear someone of your skills being paid this much money. 3. $2000 per week is a vastly discounted rate from the $5000 figure quoted above, which is appropriate for friends. Note that this is appropriate for friends working together as business partners, not for something so insignificant that a friend is doing it pro bono. That you want to be paid at all indicates this situation is not the latter. When I do technical consulting I always bill weekly. I fundamentally disagree with billing hourly for a variety of reasons, so I think you&#x27;re right that you should not be billing hourly. If you don&#x27;t want to bill weekly you can set an entire project fee. In that case, I would take the above amount and multiply it by the number of weeks you anticipate working. What I would emphasize to you is that pricing is basically arbitrary. You simply charge the highest amount the market will bear. If this project is worth doing and &quot;serious&quot; enough to warrant you being paid, you might as well be paid generously, even if it is very discounted for a friend.",

I&#x27;m used to it, honestly, because it&#x27;s become obvious over time that holding an opinion in contrast to what HN wants to hear is a nearly guaranteed ticket to comment illegibility. HN is the only forum on which I participate where disagreement is acceptably expressed as making someone&#x27;s thoughts more difficult to read. I&#x27;m merely presenting my (long earned) observations on Reddit. I absolutely think it&#x27;s a shitshow, a terrible place full of terrible people, but I suspect I&#x27;m being punished for daring to suggest that there is something wrong with the site itself. In the smaller subreddits, there are absolutely small embers of really powerfully rewarding conversation. There is stuff worth saving on Reddit, and I think the loud stuff drowns it out. I&#x27;ve had extremely fulfilling conversations about network security, application security, game modification, and polyamory in the various communities of which I am a part, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot. My experience isn&#x27;t representative because I subscribe to nearly zero default subs. To your point, I think SRS serves as the complete counterexample to everything you&#x27;re saying. The entire purpose of SRS is to brigade and single out individual Redditors, and I&#x27;ve seen the results firsthand. If FPH was doing it, there isn&#x27;t a universe in existence where SRS gets off that hook and it makes sense. Transparency is important here, as you say.",

    "text": "My point, and perhaps I was unclear, is that people seem happy to exchange the costs of density for the benefits of density (trains and airports; lots of varied good provided; many different kinds of jobs from many different employers; etc), ie, that there are no &quot;density issues&quot; with cities, it&#x27;s just that people really want to live on top of each other as much as the rapidly rising costs seem to indicate, and we haven&#x27;t adjusted to this idea as a society yet from our older vision of sparse open West and the American frontier (or pick your local myths). The post I was replying to implied that people were somehow forced in to cities -- it&#x27;s just untrue. They could be lots of other places, they just choose to be in cities. (Nothing in my post was about how cities nucleated, and was entirely about why cities have the rising costs they do, which reflect a HUGE demand for more city rather than a demand for out of the city.) I didn&#x27;t mean that if you found a unicorn, they wouldn&#x27;t prefer it, just that at the end of day, people made the compromise of plowing their fields with horses, not narwhals. Focusing on the horn as &quot;man, that would be a great feature to add!&quot; misses something interesting in why they picked the horse to the (perhaps arguably) more majestic narwhal. I would even argue that studying why the preference when you split the unicorn in to extant beings is the paramount question about the topic, since it gives us the seeds to move forward building more dense (and enjoyable!) cities and societies. I find it interesting that despite everyone lamenting how they wish they weren&#x27;t in cities, they don&#x27;t take any of the many opportunities to move to smaller cities or out of cities all together, despite there being many such chances. (Some people do, obviously, and are quite happy with their choice. I just meant that there was a net flow in to cities.) In so far as you point out that cities seem to top out a certain size that doesn&#x27;t hit any inherent physical constraints, our daydreaming about unicorns (and more importantly, our discussion of horse versus narwhal) serves to improve these limits and let us move towards more focused centers of human activity. The information age (and really... modern humans for ~10,000 years) has been driven largely by focused human intelligence, of which cities -- being a natural focal point of human efforts -- have played center stage. The story of humanity since the ice age can be glibly phrased as: we found a way to stay in one place, and grew; we found a way to get power more efficiently, and got denser, and grew; we made many theoretical breakthroughs about the mechanics of getting, storing, transporting, and using power, and got denser, and grew. The past few centuries have been a concerted effort on externalizing our various faculties, following a series of breakthroughs on fundamentals, and as a result we&#x27;ve been able to double the population in just the past ~100 years. People have picked up on the narrative, even if they don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s happening, yet. They enjoy getting to be part of the important cluster of human activity, instead of relegated to energy production out on a farm. tl;dr: You made an uncharitable reading of my posts, and failed to connect that I was using &quot;enjoy&quot; as a euphemism for the idea of a &quot;utility&quot; function, because I was talking in public, and wanted my idea to be generally understood rather than technically sound. This error in parsing my post led you to make a long rant -- concurring with me. Your violent agreement amused me, so I wrote you a rant back. [Ed: Or just flat out missed I was talking about why the skyrocketing prices, not the nucleation of new cities.] Hope you&#x27;re having a good day. (:",

On the other side I removed all the JSON things and the Pub&#x2F;Sub (IMHO is interesting to subscribe to areas to see objects entering&#x2F;exiting them, not much to position updates since it&#x27;s the same of doing PUBLISH+GEOADD from the client side). Added: GEOHASH to return a Geohash standard string from of a given element, mainly for interoperability. I&#x27;m also adding GEODIST (to calculate distances) and GEOPOS (to retrieve latitude&#x2F;longitude of objects without the need to query for radius). The work will be available in the context of Redis 3.2, unless I get mad and merge back into 3.0, which is unlikely but not impossible. EDIT: before of three days ago I was not aware of Geohashing at all, so if you have five mins to check the code, I&#x27;ll be glad :-) Thanks. I&#x27;m pretty confident that it&#x27;s ok now after I added a fuzzy test that replicates the feature (by brute forcing distance computation) in Tcl that checks against the Redis output, but still...

With things like loopback, and AngularJs Backbone&#x2F;Marionette, and EmberJs, the ability to build something as simple as a blogging system is like a week long affair at most. Especially if you ignore things like user-defined templates, and any other feature that would make more sense in a SaaS CMS. You can see the blog up now, if you disregard the URL. I just started a new job, and need to wait a paycheck or two to buy a new domain. It is sitting on an old one I bought for a now deceased project. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;compendiumjs.org",

    "text": "What is a girl band and what is a male band? The first time I saw Nashville Pussy, Corey Parks was still playing bass for them. Her brother, Cherokee was an NBA player at the time and from my place in the pit, Corey Parks looked about seven feet tall. The combination of the very tall and imposing Corey Parks playing bass on one side, combined with Ruyter Sighs playing guitar on the other was very powerful. Nashville Pussy&#x27;s lead singer and drummer were both men, but Ruyter Sighs&#x27; flat out amazing guitar playing really drove the sound. Are they a girl band or a male band? Or, what about Sonic Youth? Are they are a girl band or a male band? Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore decided they wanted to start making music, so they recruited Lee Ranaldo and eventually found a drummer. Kim Gordon was just as much a creative force as any of the men she played with and when she finally put her bass down, lo and behold, she was a damned good guitar player. Or, how about Bikini Kill? Are they a girl band or a male band? They&#x27;re most heavily associated with riot grrl and are mostly considered Kathleen Hanna&#x27;s band, but Billy Karren was a straight up incredible guitar player. If there was any justice, he would be recognized as one of the truly great musicians to come out of that soon to be famous Washington scene. Or, in a different genre, are the Cocteau Twins a girl band or a male band? I simply can&#x27;t imagine that band without Elizabeth Fraser nor would I want to. Debbie Googe and Bilinda Butcher have been members of My Bloody Valentine since the late 1980s and I simply can&#x27;t imagine what MBV would sound like without those two amazing women. Their other two members are male. Are they a girl band or a male band? Or, Slowdive? Rachel Goswell formed the band in the late 80s with a guy she knew since she was a kid. Are they a girl band or a male band? More personally, my sister is in a thrash metal band. A woman I dated several years back used to play drums in a weird shoegaze&#x2F;electronic fusion band.",

One helpful data point could be whether the library supports a (formal) custom build apparatus, since you can often get a sizable reduction that way. Full jQuery UI clocks in at ~242K, but using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jqueryui.com&#x2F;download&#x2F; you can often strip it down to 20K or less. Similarly with THREE.js and several others. Going in the other direction, a library that seems small (Backbone.js, @ ~20K) may actually end up being relatively heavy because of required external dependencies. A more explicit side-by-side &quot;compare&quot; function would also be nice here, comparing library size along with other metrics like script loader compatibility, maintenance frequency, different flavors of popularity, etc.",

It&#x27;s also true that when you directly contradict someone else&#x27;s perspective, you can expect push-back from them. The reaction of dang and others here is ample evidence of that. Getting in shouting matches makes your argument much, much less effective, not to mention making the forum for those shouting matches an unpleasant place to be. Instead of saying &quot;No, you stupid douchebag&quot;, why not phrase your argument in terms of &quot;Yes, and...&quot;? Instead of posting screeds about how early employees of startups get screwed, why not phrase it as &quot;Startup founders could solve many of their hiring problems by offering meaningful equity - not just a few percent, but enough that a successful exit is life-changing for all their early employees. This would also fix incentive alignment problems and ensure that employees keep working hard even when they&#x27;re not in the same room as the boss.&quot; You might find some unlikely allies, even among the likes of Sam Altman [1] or Andrew Mason [2]. Or instead of complaining about how Evan Spiegel is an undeserving twat who represents everything wrong with the VC industry, why not highlight the startups whose products you believe are deserving, evangelize them to friends and acquaintances, intro them to people who may help them, and help ensure that the next founder who ends up with a unicorn deserves it? As you&#x27;ve said before, negative information never gets erased, you have to &quot;flood the channel&quot; [3]. The connection that you didn&#x27;t make is that negative information (and its ensuing push-back) also reflects negatively on the person who posted it, since most readers are intelligent and can assume that there&#x27;s more to the story than the side that was posted.

While everyone should be using HTTPS over Tor and treating the exit node as they would a massive public open WiFi spot, not everyone does so. Putting such users at risk publicly exposing accidental usages of HTTP doesn&#x27;t help. Furthermore, releasing the previous-hop starts to degrade the privacy of Tor, a little bit. That&#x27;s not a good thing. LE can figure out how to go after &quot;pedophiles and terrorists&quot; using other gumshoe techniques, instead of trying to downgrade everyone&#x27;s opsec. Not to mention this idea of vigilantism is... a terribly bad idea (to put it politely)? You&#x27;re actually advocating that people go lynch&#x2F;kill others based on Internet traffic logs. Nothing&#x27;s stopping all sorts of sites from embedding links to &quot;bad&quot; content and framing people. Or, exit nodes can just fake the log information if they wanted to.",

    "text": "I think it&#x27;s easier to explain this in terms of likelihood theory. Likelihood is the probability of observed data GIVEN A SPECIFIC MODEL. This is NOT to be confused with the probability of a specific model being correct GIVEN THE OBSERVED DATA. It is the later probability that people want to really know, but confusing it with the former probability can have catastrophic consequences in fields like medicine, engineering, jurisprudence, finance and insurance. The problem is related to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Fallacy ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prosecutor%27s_fallacy ): &quot;Consider this case: a lottery winner is accused of cheating, based on the improbability of winning. At the trial, the prosecutor calculates the (very small) probability of winning the lottery without cheating and argues that this is the chance of innocence. The logical flaw is that the prosecutor has failed to account for the large number of people who play the lottery.&quot; There is a mathematical statistics professor at the University of Toronto named D.A.S. Fraser ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utstat.utoronto.ca&#x2F;dfraser&#x2F; ) who is an expert in likelihood theory and has commented on this issue: &quot;...statistics does have the answer! The answer is contained in the p-value function from likelihood theory: p(delta) Here delta is the relevant parameter with delta_0 as the null value and delta_1 as the alternative needing detection. Then p(delta_0) is the observed p-value, p(delta_1) is the detection probability, and the rest is judgement: the route to the Higgs boson.&quot;",

The chances that both the DC and the user would get hit by the same natural disaster are relatively small. Still, it&#x27;s not a storage service like S3 so geo-redundancy plays a smaller role. We do plan on building out other datacenters in the future, but since we&#x27;re bootstrapped, we have to do that when the time is right, otherwise it would be very easy to over-extend ourselves and start losing money. edit -&gt; I ignored your Backblaze dev question, sorry.

The editor ran like absolute rubbish originally on macs, to the point where it was actually unusable. They&#x27;ve done a lot of work on that, but it&#x27;s still miles away from the unity editor. I think it&#x27;s really hard to argue the unreal editor is better; it&#x27;s a lot slower , but it does have some nice tools. You also can&#x27;t create extensions as easily (if at all?) as you can for unity. As you say, they&#x27;re two different things, and the unreal editor is actually not bad... but if you were to compare them, the unity one would certainly rank more highly.",

Many open source projects do something like this, a dual license where the source code for the project is GPL, but the creator is willing to license it for something as non-gpl to people unwilling to release their source code. This requirement set by unreal is very very analogous. They just have some shifted priorities, however for me this project now meets the standard of what I would consider &quot;ethical&quot;. Could it be better? Sure why not? It could be GPL dual license, people who want to benefit from open source but release closed source I think should have to pay, that would be better. However, this library can now be effectively used for open source initiatives. This is fantastic. That&#x27;s my estimation of the situation anyway, you perhaps do not see it like this.

C++ is needed if you want to extend the native classes. Regarding the editor, unreal is pretty amazing. It really shines in the tools department. Check out the landscape editor, materials editor, and animation tools on youtube. Pretty fantastic stuff. The game engine itself is better than unity in almost every way with a few big exceptions: 1) multiplayer map size. unity can pretty easily support large online worlds 2) support for mobile&#x2F;tablets. unity is the dominant platform on those devices. 3) community support. unity has a much larger community, better documentation, and a much more populous online store (though unreal is catching up)",

    "text": "Can you even compare them :) Evaluation of software, be it library, framework, sdk or a whole engine+tools is much much harder than writing actual software, especially when royalties, copyright and other legal issues are involved. In reality there is no way of knowing what would do your best, so you can look at specific bad parts and take that into decision making, for example, for what I&#x27;ve heard (and possibly it could be wrong): - Unity is not really good when lots of people have to edit the same files, merging is not really good, and the server option does not really cut it. (For example Quake&#x27;s engine .map text files are not so bad to merge in cvs&#x2F;svn&#x2F;p4&#x2F;etc.) - Unreal had always had the bad &quot;fame&quot; of 30-only fps game, while this is okay for certain shooters, or 3rd person games, it would&#x27;ve never worked for &quot;Call of Duty&quot; where the brand was simply established with 60fps. To some people this might sound a bit pedantic, but 60fps matters! (And &gt;60fps does not really, unless you need to swap frames for a 3D VR device of sort) That to be said both engines surely have really good parts. From little I&#x27;ve explored in Unity, what got me first was the ability to extend the editor while it&#x27;s running - I could add menus with functionality while it was running - this is super cool. Unreal on the other side is well known engine with lots of people from the AAA game industry familiar with it, and while the editor might seem completely foreign to people starting in the game industry, it&#x27;s pretty well known by many others (I guess they don&#x27;t advertise it much). The hidden gem of Unreal for me, was it&#x27;s internal UI system, which could be used as a separate project - it has docking, controls, etc. - it might be a good replacement for Qt, MFC, wxWidgets, etc.",

(1) Availability (Something fails eventually), both in terms of monitoring (Find out) and failover (How to resolve when this happens?) (2) Security (Who had access to which key when? Are they still at the company? Where&#x27;s the audit trail? Third-party managed security credentials ... can you say side-channel?) (3) Legal jurisdiction (Are we allowed to put x in y location? Do we want government x using law y to potentially perform action z ?) (4) Latency (Site x on provider y is experiencing a DDoS) (5) Heterogeneous management (What happens if something auto-managed gets manually-managed for awhile? Do things break?) (6) Resource lead time and failure impact (What happens when the hardware you just wanted to spin up from the endless cloud supply isn&#x27;t available?) (7) Actual performance characteristics (Usually every provider offers only a specific selection of environments and offers weak to no SLAs&#x2F;guarantees on real world performance.) ... and so on. A lot of these are sort of cloud restatements of the RFC1925[1] fundamental truths of networking. Also, this is all docker-specific, so it hinges on people wanting to build their infrastructure on a self-described insecure and immature platform and tie their whole management paradigm to it. FWIW, I am still working on an OS and virtualization platform agnostic alternative devops process management tool[2] and am trying to get my company to agree to open source it. It can easily wrap docker, having far broader scope, and was designed to be future-proofed... it is thus potentially useful for embedded dev, the BSDs, real hardware, clusters, etc. It takes a very different paradigm to docker, abstracting cloud providers, services and platforms separately, and allowing the former to figure out how to connect and manage the other two internally... with standardized interfaces for major operations and notifications.

Back in the early days of computers, many of them like the C64 or TRS80 (circa 1985-ish) had an option to use a TV as a monitor to save money.

There were a number of relatives and friends visiting and myself someone that shared my love of computing were in the there programming away, and really programming, we are talking assembler here. And after a couple of hours we came down to the living room and everyone had the TV on channel 3 and everyone was watching us (I did not realize the splitter was broadcasting throughout the cable in our house). I guess there was nothing better on back them before cable had 100&#x27;s of channels.

The company is well funded ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creandum.com&#x2F;why-creandum-invested-omniata&#x2F; ) &amp; headquartered in SF. The bulk of R&amp;D will be done in the Helsinki office which at the moment only has a small team, so this is a great opportunity to get in early and grow with the company. As a backend engineer you’ll be part of the team responsible for infrastructure code handling millions of events each month. Tasks will include improving existing components and creating new systems for scaling, automating and monitoring of processes. Knowledge of Perl &amp; Bash is expected, however if you’re more comfortable with another dynamic language like Python or Ruby and have a good grasp of low level Linux, we should still talk. Familiarity with C would also be an advantage. As a UX designer you will be responsible for a creating the UIs and improving the UX of Omniata&#x27;s web interfaces that allow Omniata&#x27;s customers to make the most of their data. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript would be a plus, but is not a must. If you&#x27;re at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile (in the case of backend) or portfolio (in the case of UX) to careers-hl@omniata.com",

I forget exactly what it was but it was something like &quot;Java Python Flash Linux game developer&quot; or whatever. I had learned about this from an out-of-the-blue client lead who emailed me. I was shocked when he said that&#x27;s how he found me. I then went around to about a dozen different computers, different types, different geo locations in my state, both auth&#x27;ed and anonymous, and sure enough I always came up as top result, first page. It was... an awesome time to be taking on contract&#x2F;consulting work, let me tell you. So many more leads coming in than before. Not enough hours in the week&#x2F;month to help them, had to turn down otherwise interesting gigs. Then it came to an end. Rug pulled out. Woke up one day, rankings changed, no longer on top like that. Lesson (one anyway): that&#x27;s a huge eyeball funnel. bazillions of people doing searches. even getting a tiny slice of it means tons of eyeballs stumbling upon you. quality is important, of course, being great at what you do, having the right leads, a good fit, avail, etc. But quantity? That has a quality of its own.",

    "text": "If Rosetta had an operations crew nearby - even just one person - the cost of the mission would have been, what, 100x greater? Surely enough more expensive to pay for multiple robotic probes. Total mission cost for Rosetta = 1.4 billion Euros. It costs something like $50,000&#x2F;kg for GEO, so I&#x27;ll use that as the baseline. The Orion capsule weighs 21 tons and the Deep Space Habitat at least 50 tons. Add one person and the 5 kg of consumables per day, for a mission of 300 days, gives another 2 tons. That&#x27;s $3 billion already, or 2.4 billion Euros. Now add the development costs, support staff, communications, etc. and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to send a small fleet of redundant probes than to send a single human. To double check, an Orion capture of an asteroid in an orbit close to Earth&#x27;s is $2.6 billion (see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orion_%28spacecraft%29#Explorat... ), again, excluding development costs. In any case, we have no way to put a human on the same orbit as a comet, much less return the human safely to Earth, so only a robot mission is possible.",

It can be a little confusing and overwrought at times, and I don&#x27;t think the lifetimes are as clear as they could be. IMO, more languages shouldn&#x27;t assume that there is a single memory allocator. That&#x27;s one of the worst assumptions I see in systems languages -- even C++ (before C++11) got this entirely wrong. Swift gets this wrong, Go gets this wrong. Rust is probably a little better because it actually has a static idea of memory scope, but I haven&#x27;t seen a way to swap out the memory allocator in various contexts. Most projects I&#x27;ve been involved with have used region&#x2F;arena allocators. Not only do you mostly avoid the non-determism of your average GC, but you avoid the hassle of fine grained reference counting (in most cases). This relies on you choosing the scopes for your regions appropriately, but there usually is a clear scope to attach things to (e.g. frames, iteration of an event loop, etc.).",

    "text": "(I&#x27;m the author&#x2F;founder.) Old one did distributed breadth-first graph exploration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zerotier&#x2F;ZeroTierOne&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OLD-Multicast-A... It was nifty and cool and worked pretty well for small to mid tier stuff, but biggest disadvantages in practice were: (1) Peers seem to drop the potato more often than I predicted when I simulated it, leading to a lot of truncated propagations. It also has no geo-awareness, so if your propagation graph goes through sub-Saharan Africa you&#x27;re likely to see a lot of packet loss. I think my simulations implicitly assumed all high-end first-world broadband links, when reality includes the whole world and a lot of slow&#x2F;crummy cellular. (2) High latency, which caused problems for people who wanted low-latency multicast for SDN-type applications (enterprise stuff). In the beginning I never considered those applications, but they&#x27;re emerging as a major user base. (3) Imposed a high CPU cost, since to prevent flooding every packet had to be cryptographically signed by its originating node. That&#x27;s a lot of ECC256 signatures and verifications. (4) Mobile-unfriendly, since mobile devices really want to be able to enter long-term hibernation and not have to wake to help others propagate their multicasts. Mobile might even want to turn off most multicast, only allowing ARP and NDP or even emulating these for no multicast at all. (Currently working on iOS and Android ZT1 ports.) This also applies to tiny low power embedded devices, and I&#x27;ve had some interest from Internet-of-things experimenters. There&#x27;s no write-up on the new algorithm yet, but it&#x27;s basically sender-side replication with lazy but deterministic gathering. It gathers recipients up to the limit from supernodes and from peers. (In reality supernodes are peers-- they&#x27;re merely peers designated as such.) I remember initially passing on that idea since I was afraid it would be too heavy on the sender, but observing real traffic flows shows that in aggregate the multicast traffic load ends up close to the same. Sender-side replication is also inherently fair -- sender pays the price -- so you don&#x27;t need such heavy signature&#x2F;verification checks to ensure that somebody can&#x27;t flood the network. This way it&#x27;s no easier to flood with multicast than with unicast. (Obviously anyone can DDOS but that&#x27;s another matter.) In the longer term I plan to add some support for merging of multicasts going to the same local network or site, but I&#x27;m not sure how yet... it&#x27;s probably going to intersect with R&amp;D work I&#x27;m doing right now on enterprise supernode federation for SDN applications and similar stuff.",

    "text": "Hi MichaelGG, I am a Program Manager for Azure Search and as curiousDog mentioned, yes along with DocumentDB, we also announced Azure Search which is a PaaS based full text search service. We actually leverage ElasticSearch at the core of this service and as chippy says about spatial search, we do have the ability to provide a pretty solid geo-spatial search capability thanks to Elastic Search and Lucene. To nemothekids&#x27;s point, is it very unlikely that we will offer this as a local (non-hosted) version because we found that although ElasticSearch is awesome, one of the common complaints many admin&#x27;s have is the complexity around managing systems such as ElasticSearch&#x2F;SOLR&#x2F;Lucene at high scale and how difficult it is to implement more advanced search capabilities such as tuning and relevancy. Those are areas we think we can add a lot of value being a fully managed service. Longer term, we think this will also allow us to bring even more value on top of search by adding in other Microsoft technologies. For example, we could tie in Bing Maps to allow you to easily tie in reverse geo-coding right into your search. Or perhaps allow you to leverage Bing&#x27;s synonym list so that you could allow people to search yet find results that are synonyms to commonly searched words (i.e., user types in shoes, but in your content it is referred to as footwear). Multi-language support is actually one of the big things we want to tackle in the short term and we believe that the NLP from Office will really help jump start us with this. Liam",

I really like the interface, I&#x27;m very impressed with how well it works for most tracks (and fast too), but by making it dependent on difficult external parties like youtube and soundcloud I don&#x27;t see it taking off. I&#x27;ve had very similar usability problems with all other projects that attempt similar things. edit : I&#x27;ll check back for the updated TOS later. I&#x27;m curious what they&#x27;ll say...",

    "text": "It depends on how you plan your future. I&#x27;ve used quite a few text editors over the years (Bluefish, Scite, Homesite, Phase5, Idle, TextMate, Vim, others). I switched to Emacs more than a year ago with one clear goal: Not having to switch anymore. You see, most of the editors above (except vim) used to be good and then were deprecated, sold, stopped, and so on. Which of those has been existing for more than 20 years and is still able to hold up to new editors. Sadly, none (One could argue for TextMate 2, but in between there were many, many years of staleness). I was fed up with having to switch to a newfangled editor every so many years, having to identify new plugins, having to learn new keybindings. I&#x27;ve used Vim for 7 years (I think) and it came pretty close, but in the end the archaic VimScript language and the lack of async commands was something that was nagging me. I wanted to call an editor home, and hone my skills until I pass away, increasing my arcane knowledge over 10-20 years, learning ever more about the scripting language, commands, and writing more and more specific plugins that help with my tasks. I still want to be coding in 10 years, but I don&#x27;t want to switch text editors ever again. Emacs shall be my final editor [1], and that&#x27;s why I decided to switch. Because I can see Emacs still going strong in another 20 years. I wouldn&#x27;t want to say that about Sublime, or really any other editor right now. [1] There&#x27;s a case to be made that NeoVim is going to be great, and it may well be, but right now I&#x27;m really, really, really happy with Emacs + Evil. Nothing is perfect, of course, but the things that bug me are really, really small things that I could probably even fix, if I&#x27;d invest enough time; but they don&#x27;t bug me enough for that.",

We sometimes watch your scotch friday meetings, and Jack comes to our neck of the woods for a &quot;scotch tuesday&#x2F;wednesday&quot; every so often. In more relevant news, the CEO (Jonathan Bush) just wrote a book (&quot;wrote&quot;, he joked) that&#x27;s a semi-right-wing take on the problem posed in this article (lack of EHR interoperability). Solid read though regardless of politics. Also, the MDP program (the API you&#x27;re referring to) is more designed to allow third party developers to build functionality onto athenanet that we don&#x27;t have the specialization or capacity to build. It&#x27;s not really a means of sharing health data (to my knowledge). However! We have been making the sharing of EHR data a priority, or at least seeming to, with the formation of the CommonWell Health Alliance (members including most major EHR creators... except Epic, because they&#x27;re Epic). Additionally, we&#x27;re working on some stuff with athenaCommunicator to help hospitals talk to labs, and stuff with Coordinator that I think involves the Austin crew too... but I don&#x27;t know what of Coordinator we&#x27;re allowed to talk about yet so I&#x27;ll probably shut up on that matter.",

    "text": "People go to such amazing lengths to avoid getting a ticket, but it&#x27;s very easy to speed and not get pulled over. 1) Don&#x27;t drive stupid. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to drive very fast without driving badly. If you&#x27;re swerving a lot, accelerating then stomping on your brakes, jerking from lane to lane... it&#x27;s an indication that you&#x27;re not planning ahead and are therefore driving badly. You deserve to get pulled over. And for heaven&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t race unless you&#x27;re willing to get pulled. Be a little grown up. 2) Go as fast as you want - but don&#x27;t be the fastest car on the road. Always let a cop-catcher run about a 1&#x2F;4 mile to 1&#x2F;2 mile ahead (don&#x27;t tailgate them, that&#x27;ll get you pulled over for speeding and being an ass). 3) Don&#x27;t use a detector. They give you a false sense of security and will guarantee that if you do get pulled, you get a ticket. Not only that, 90% of the time no officer is going to leave the radar &quot;wide open&quot; on all passing cars - which means your detector won&#x27;t go off until after you&#x27;ve been tagged. 4) Don&#x27;t speed in residential areas. There&#x27;s just no gain. Bonus tips: 1) As much as possible, stay out of the left hand lane. That&#x27;s just easy pickings right there. edit: that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s okay to zip around people on the right. Just don&#x27;t sit there with the pedal on the floor. be there when you need to be - but don&#x27;t be there when you don&#x27;t . 2) When in an area that you can&#x27;t see possible hiding spaces get adept at feathering your speed down a bit and letting a car (ok) suv (better) , van or truck (best) on the left side shield you from that spot. Edit: again to clarify this doesn&#x27;t mean zip around on the right. You&#x27;re actually going to be gong slower or matching these cars, preferably from two lanes away. If you don&#x27;t have two lanes, don&#x27;t do this. 3) At night it&#x27;s especially easy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same in all staets ,but every one I&#x27;ve driven through cops have their headlights on while they wait. If you look far enough ahead - and you should be anyway otherwise you&#x27;re driving poorly and deserve a ticket - you can see a copy waiting a half mile off or more. 4) If you think you&#x27;ve been tagged, don&#x27;t slam your brakes. In addition to being a hazard, the cop has already tagged you - and the sudden flare of brakelights is a surefire giveaway to the fact that you know you were speeding. (This one is the hardest for most people...) In the 1980s &quot;A Speeder&#x27;s Guide to Avoiding Tickets&quot; came out, written by a state patrol officer. I think most of what I do up there is a variation on what&#x27;s in that book. If you speed a lot but are willing to do so intelligently and safely, you should get it. It&#x27;s excellent and still as valid. Anyway - that got long-winded. TL;DR: speed smart and safe, don&#x27;t be an idiot, and pay attention and you don&#x27;t need to spend money on a fancy license plate frame. (Or a FOP sticker in other states...) - Speeding ticket free (and driving fast and smart in muscle cars) for more years than I can recall.",

When I was 4 we had a cable box and a TV. I could obviously see that the cable box had its own volume and its video output was its own thing that only went to one channel on the TV itself, because it was what turned the cable wire coming in into a signal, which it put on its output cable wire directed to only one channel, channel 3 or 4, and that that applied to its volume as well. Nobody explained it to me, I could just tell by looking at it.

With that not all WIFI is the same and not all routers configured well and with that is blueetooth suffering from congestion. I would also say somebody of Paul Grahams status who&#x27;s time can be costed higher than most should learn to let go of these trivial matters and delegate. Not that they can&#x27;t diagnose and go thru logs, just that there time is more valueuable and than dealing with such teadious matters.

Just make sure you aren&#x27;t tying any identity you care about to dangerous transactions. That&#x27;s the only (and of course difficult) trick. If a drug buyer in a BTC transaction got the coins anonymously (say, sent a self-destructing robot to drop off cash in exchange for BTC), then that part is fine. They can go use those coins anonymously. If they ship drugs to their house, well... that alone sort of undoes it all. The drug sellers that were caught from Silk Road were caught due to things like making a huge amount of trips to post offices, getting the attention of postal workers. That may be a parallel construction, but it seems legitimate enough. Buy drugs from large seller, look at the postmarks for patterns. Then go gumshoeing around and wait &#x27;til you see the same car or people going to the same post offices over and over and over. You can probably pull this attack off without even having government capabilities.",

Yes, it feels unfair when Google drops you in search results, and Google has changed the rules over the years and it&#x27;s hard to keep up with shifting guidelines. In truth, the website can recover from this. The same people who placed spammy links on 3rd party sites in order to manipulate rankings are probably savvy enough to mount a clean up effort to get those links removed and&#x2F;or file a disavow request with Google (which basically tells them to ignore those links) Ironically, Eric Schmidt once tried to scrub Google of unfavorable search results about himself, and he was told they do not do that for individual results. ;)",

Keep in mind that removing links will probably not return your previous rankings, since the links that once caused you to rank well may now be the ones causing the problem. Removing them may restore your ability to rank well again. Also, not every ranking drop means that you were penalized. If you know you had built lots of spammy links, and your traffic dropped off at the same time Penguin was updated, then it is more likely a Penguin problem. Otherwise, there are hundreds of reasons that would need to be examined. If you are not sure, consider hiring a reputable SEO consultant to help. It won&#x27;t be cheap.

    "text": "I live in DC, and work intel-community adjacent in the infosec industry. I&#x27;ll stipulate up front that I&#x27;ve never worked as a government employee, and despite doing some assessment work (like being hired to break into the Department of the Interior without their knowledge, or breaking hardware&#x2F;software that was being deployed in far away places) everywhere I&#x27;ve worked has tried very hard to steer clear of government work (not for any ethical reasons, it just pays much worse than equivalent commercial work, and is almost always boring). In fact, the last two places I worked had distinct government and commercial divisions (where I ran the commercial divisions). That said, I&#x27;ve built and run several security consulting practices in the DC area, and consequently have done hiring interviews for dozens of people who were NSA employees (1 of which we ended up hiring). Absolutely none of them have even the slightest apprehension about the nature of the work they were doing (so much as they were able to comment about it during interviews). In fact, prior to the Snowden leaks, the NSA was pretty much at the bottom of my list for government agencies doing shit I disliked. They have a pretty clear scope and charter (which we&#x27;ve come to learn has been muddied). But no one I&#x27;ve talked to, either who works there or works at a contractor in the DIB, thinks they&#x27;ve done anything wrong. Did you read those batshit NSA talking points that came out yesterday from Al Jazeera&#x27;s FOIA request? They believe those things. They think they&#x27;re doing important, valuable work to protect the country. I can only imagine that internally within NSA there has been dissent about some of the stuff that&#x27;s come out. Maybe people have resigned over it, maybe they&#x27;ve sent strongly-worded emails to their bosses. I really hope there was a great deal of dissent about the &quot;intentionally fuck up crypto standards that we push to other branches of the government&quot;, but I doubt we&#x27;ll ever hear much about it. Your questions could just as easily refer to people who work on SEO spam, or targeted advertisements (I&#x27;m not saying those things are equivalent, but they&#x27;re also jobs I&#x27;ve heard people on here posturing morally about).",

    "text": "Ok, this guy is using a couple of methods off BlackHatWorld (Probably the biggest SEO forum around if you haven&#x27;t heard of it) So essentially this guy is building this site, ranking it in Google using the churn &#x27;n Burn method, then once its ranking well he&#x27;ll contact local business saying he can link to them in return for a fee. Even though the domain is 6 months old, if you look at ahrefs this guy has 33k backlinks to the homepage. Google had a major SEO update on October 4th which essentially fucked up their algorithm more than it already was. This churn &#x27;n burn method means that you spam out a zillion backlinks and you will rank really well until the next Google update comes along (which is around 3-4 months) You could do this in the previous Google update (Penguin 2.1) and I thought Google would fix this but they just made it easier. This is a good example of the method: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackhatworld.com&#x2F;blackhat-seo&#x2F;black-hat-seo&#x2F;5769... (This was the one of the guys that essentially figured out this method from what I can tell) So with this new Google update, they are getting rid of some of the spammy sites, but more spam sites just taken their places in the rankings. Now they are focusing on the amount of content on your site rather than the backlinks. So now 10 year old sites with hundreds of legitimate, high authority backlinks are getting outranked but spammy sites with 14 backlinks and 300 gibberish articles. I&#x27;ve also been reading that with local Google searches, you get results from completely different countries. For example, people in the UK were reporting that they were getting results from sites in Russia, Argentina and New Zealand instead of UK results. I don&#x27;t think this happens as much in America from what I know. So I&#x27;m guessing Google is eventually going to iron out these problems, but it&#x27;s a battleground at the moment. If you do get outranked by this guy, make a video with your keywords in the title, same with a Facebook and LinkedIn page and then buy a bunch of backlinks off Fiverr. They should outrank pretty much any other website in a matter of days.",

    "text": "Hey all, this is the author of Ginkgo &amp; Gomega. I&#x27;m excited to see all this thoughtful conversation and figured I&#x27;d chime in with a response to keep the conversation going. (Apologies for the long post!) - Godoc documentation is coming soon. Godoc is great for API-style documentation but not particularly appropriate for tutorial&#x2F;structured&#x2F;narrative-style documentation. Think golang.org&#x2F;pkg vs golang.org&#x2F;doc. I wanted to write the &#x2F;doc first as I believe it to be more valuable for beginners and is often overlooked by the go community. &#x2F;pkg is coming soon (a few days) and is much easier to write. - @buro9: Golang is BDD-style in the same way that Cedar and Jasmine are BDD-style. This is not Cucumber (way too much DSL for me!) With that said, asynchronous testing support is baked right into Ginkgo and Gomega so the API-testing that you&#x27;d like would be easily expressed in Ginkgo and Gomega. - Assertions that I have fundamentally misunderstood Golang or the distinction between dynamic and static typed languages are interesting and I&#x27;d like to address some of them. BDD-style testing need not be limited to dynamically-typed language. Yes dynamically-typed languages need far more comprehensive test coverage to make up for the missing compiler. That&#x27;s why I tend to prefer statically-typed languages. To me BDD-style (vs the XUnit style) isn&#x27;t primarily about addressing these deficiencies in dynamic languages -- it&#x27;s about expressiveness . To that end, I think that BDD and Golang go hand in hand. Let me explain. BDD is exceptionally good at describing the behavior of branching code. Golang is filled with branching code that needs to be described in test. Here&#x27;s a classic example in pseudo-go: func DoSomethingAwesome(dependencyA DepA, dependencyB DepB) awesome Awesome, err error { stuffA, err := dependencyA.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } stuffB, err := dependencyB.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } .... return awesome, nil } With Ginkgo you can cover these branches expressively: Describe(&quot;Doing something Awesome&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;common happy case setup Context(&quot;When all is well&quot;, func() { It(&quot;should be awesome&quot;, ...) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyA fails&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;set dependencA up for failure It(&quot;should return a zero Awesome&quot;, func() { ... Expect(awesome).To(BeZero()) }) It(&quot;should error&quot;, func() { ... Expect(err).To(HaveOccured()) }) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyB fails&quot;, func() { &#x2F;&#x2F;etc... }) }) Compare this to the XUnit style: func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenAllIsWell() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyAFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyBFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } I prefer the former (note: that&#x27;s a subjective statement). IMO there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally more Golangish about the latter (if anything the fact that func&#x27;s that begin with Test are special is kinda weird), and since Gomega&#x27;s matchers are fluent in Go they know about things like zero values and errors having occured. Moreover, both Ginkgo and Gomega have been built to make testing asynchronous code (read: concurrent goroutines) easy and expressive. This isn&#x27;t a carbon copy of RSpec&#x2F;Cedar&#x2F;Jasmine, it&#x27;s a synthesis of the best ideas from those testing frameworks expressed in ways that cater specifically to Golang. - Concerns about using interface{} and reflection seem odd to me. First off, the Go authors provide both of these things to precisely solve the sort of problem that Gomega is trying to solve. Nobody wants to write and maintain matchers that look like: Expect(foo).To(EqualInt64(3)) Expect(bar).To(EqualString(&quot;blarp&quot;)) Expect(baz).To(EqualMyCustomAwesomeType(awesome)) besides the reflect package&#x27;s `DeepEqual` does a great job comparing `interface{}` to `interface{}` correctly. Most importantly of all: we&#x27;re all using interface{} all the time: `fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d %f %s %v&quot;, ...)`! And thanks for seeing the point @karma_fountain: Gomega&#x27;s matchers have excellent reporting about what precisely went wrong when a matcher fails. Bare assertions lack this and a look through the Go tests shows a lot of reinventing-the-wheel to provide what probably amounts to inconsistent error output to the developer. Why not put that all in one place, call it a matcher library, and make it dead easy to write custom matchers? - And @shoo: yes, thanks for pointing it out: the example is somewhat fabricated and isn&#x27;t a compelling argument for BDD vs XUnit. It&#x27;s hard to cook up a good BDD example in very short space!",

    "text": "(context: i&#x27;ve been working mainly with python, and have almost no experience with go) My initial reaction to the example was that it looked like something that could be easily unit-tested, without the added layer of BDD over the top. But that&#x27;s probably just a symptom of the example appearing as something that would be simple to build and test. E.g. in python i&#x27;d translate `Expect(scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;]).To(Equal(1))` to `assert scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;] == 1` which is essentially the same, but only uses one bit of machinery (assert) rather than three. That said, the more ways to test things the merrier. I think if you are interested in testing larger chunks of functionality &#x2F; user-facing bits of behaviour rather than invariants of the building blocks of your program, then perhaps BDD starts to look more appealing, so the two approaches seems complementary. Having an expressive static type system is again complementary, as that prevents you from making many trivial errors, and you just have to test for the remaining ones that the type system cannot express. (i miss that in python) after a little dig through the code, it looks like &quot;EXPECT foo TO EQUAL barr&quot; translates as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;gomega.go#L15 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L27 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L48 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers.go#L7 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers&#x2F;equal_ma... so there&#x27;s lots of `interface{}`s and reflection and so on",

    "text": "Long distance is tempting, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily a good idea. All kinds of wireless interference&#x2F;collision will make available bandwidth really low. For example, on 2.4 GHz 802.11 protocols, there are 11 channels from 1 to 11. All wireless routers operating in US have to be on one of the 11 channels. When there are other wireless APs within the range, you and others share the channel. There&#x27;s a limitation on how much bandwidth a channel can give in total. That&#x27;s the hard limitation, given that CSMA&#x2F;CA works well. That&#x27;s why channel 3 and channel 8 often work great (most wireless routers have default channel choice 1, 6, or 11) - they are far away from defaults that others are using. Same thing applies to 5 GHz 802.11 networks. Now back to this project. 1 km is really long distance. You get communication range as large as a circle with radius being 1 km. There are a lot of wireless devices that fall in this range. You might not get affected by them since they don&#x27;t have that powerful antennas, but your signals will effectively lower the bandwidth of all routers in the area.",

    "text": "In SEO, the user makes an overt action (search) and the ranking of search then can affects what the user sees. We&#x27;ve grown to accept that. In social-graph-optimisation the overt act is much higher granularity - its to follow &#x2F; friend another person. So the game is to join as many graphs as possible, or to find the graph of the person you want, and join that. I think this granularity problem will severely limit the acceptance of SEO-for-social-graphs. Seo right now works because it is possible to finesse at the right granularity level as a function of a users action. Geo-location work will also massively help - but social is effectively painting ads onto my friends T-Shirts in the hope I will read them. I struggle to see the next fine grained action (*) We need a better term than social media, because this is all just variations on an individual has their own webspace, and updates that space regularly, plus a central scraping service to let others know. The important bit is that Ts&amp;Cs play less of a &quot;real&quot; part in this than might seem true - essentially the Ts&amp;Cs cover FB&#x2F;Twitter business model, and less the privacy of the user.",

    "text": "Its not lying and cheating nor illegal to say &quot;I will build you a purple widget for your website, you can have it by Friday. The widget will cost you 1000 bucks&quot; Get away from selling your time please. Sell something else, sell a feature, sell a widget, sell a service. As a &quot;bum on seat&quot; I have charged by the hour, the day, the week or even a month. And each an every time I was expected to, contracted to do 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I was an employee. I could not supply them a simple single product, custom built for them because I had to wade through meetings and politics and inertia and everything else we all know and love. They were too disorganised, too chaotic, too out of control to know what they wanted at a level below &quot;months of work from dozens of people&quot;, and so the ride continued. This is where the Internet is opening up new opportunities - because now it is dismantling (read automating) traditional marketing and even management . One guy can reach a global audience with good SEO, and one group of people can do away with 80% of industrial world management (including geo-co-location). And all that will dismantle the chaotic crazy world of contractors selling their time inside corporations who need software but are not able to deal with the implications. The contracting world will look very different in ten years. It will look a lot like what patio11 is selling. So, stop selling your time - instead sell a packet of something, for about the price of a week of your time, to do something that will take about a week of your time. It looks a lot like selling a week of your time, except that * it does not say so in the contract * it is something you can and will automate. Selling a product is 80%+ automated and 20% custom. Selling a productised-consult is 20% automated and 80% custom. The more that 80% dives down, the more profit you make in your &quot;week&quot;. However the more it looks like a product, the less you can charge :-) Do I care that my accountant only spends an hour looking over an annual return he got by pressing a button, yet charges a grand? No, because I make up for it on chats over coffee and the knowledge that he would catch the horror of a mistake and fix it. No horror, good for him. However that week he did tackle a horror for someone. Next time it will be me.",

    "text": "&quot;TFA&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;the fine article&quot; (Other adjectives are sometimes inferred, much like &quot;RTFM&quot;.) You&#x27;ll find the link at the top of this page, but here it is again: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bicycling.com&#x2F;senseless&#x2F; The quote in this case was attributed to Steven Madey, an orthopedic surgeon who designs bike helmets and other biomechanical devices. As near as I can tell, he was summarizing the studies in this field. (Well, maybe one would say he was summarizing the public health studies rather but not the clinical studies.) Here&#x27;s another summary: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medpagetoday.com&#x2F;CriticalCare&#x2F;HeadTrauma&#x2F;39122 Not to be any sort of jerk, but until you&#x27;ve spent enough time cycling in traffic to be comfortable, your intuition regarding the safety of that activity is suspect. Several factors are involved. First of all, there is the risk compensation phenomenon ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pubmed&#x2F;21418079 ), which is also seen for seatbelt-wearers etc. and causes users of any &quot;safety&quot; device to behave less safely to compensate for that use. This phenomenon also applies to other road users, so that when they see a cyclist they perceive to be &quot;protected&quot; by a helmet they don&#x27;t give her as much space, they drive faster, etc. ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0001457506... ) Other factors are follow-on effects from the fact that requiring helmets reduces cycling rates ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w15658 ): fewer cyclists make for more dangerous roads for everyone ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ctc.org.uk&#x2F;campaign&#x2F;safety-in-numbers ) and cyclists who cycle less aren&#x27;t as good at cycling. There is a &quot;rhythm&quot; to riding in traffic, and after I&#x27;ve taken some time off, I have to be more careful until I sharpen up. With regular practice, you know: - exactly how close the damn delivery truck is going to pass, just by the engine sound - which car is going to change lanes without signalling, not from its brakelights but from its slight pause in acceleration - how fast you have to pedal to intimidate an entering SUV into waiting for you to pass instead of turning left completely across all lanes - the distinct whine of a BMW (the official car of assholes) that&#x27;s going to attempt a right hook from 50 feet behind - etc.",

    "text": "Well, it's actually a bit more complicated than that. The bug is definitely something we wanted to know about, and we're thankful for the report. That said, there are some constraints that we put in place for the reward program to protect researchers from harm. For example, we don't want physical security or the police second-guessing the intent of someone trying to sneak into one of our buildings - so we set a very clear scope for the program, pragmatically focusing on our user-facing applications and excluding things such as attacks on our facilities and corporate infrastructure. It's a broad exclusion, but it's hard to come up with something finer-grained yet clear enough. In the same vein, we ask researches that they don't go after any systems unless it's perfectly clear that the application is owned and operated by us - for example, because it's in an IP range registered to us. Again, while this may be more limiting than we'd like, it protects the community against overly litigious parties if the system proves to belong to somebody else. In several unusually serious cases, we have made case-by-case exceptions and have paid external researchers for nominally non-qualifying bugs; but it's a tricky balance, and we use this power very cautiously.

Regardless, for any library, it's important to learn the fundamentals before using them, such as DOM basics in JavaScript before even using jQuery. To answer the original question, yes, it's important to learn server-side frameworks since there's still many things about them that client-side rendering can't do (better search engine optimization, progressive enhancement, accessibility).",

    "text": "I seriously despise \"search engine optimization\" as an \"industry\" or specialization of this internet industry. What a bullshit term. Read it back to yourself: &#62; Search Engine Optimization They're already liars. They aren't optimizing anybody's search engine. They're optimizing HTML so that it can be easily parsed and crawled, but that doesn't sound as sexy. It's marketing hocus pocus, tantamount to chart reading for day traders in the stock market. Just like chart readers, gazing into the Rorschach blots of spikes and trends in the stock market, they don't truly understand, and can't honestly answer to, how their composite numbers tie back to reality. They honestly have no control over the search engines they claim to optimize for, and have only an outsider's probed understanding of the internal workings of the search engines they target. The exception to this is when former employees of search engines are hired as consultants at these places that claim to offer these services, but honestly aside from that sort of intra-industry incest, what else do they have to offer? SEO as a term is a throwback to the late 90's when a lot of people didn't really understand what search engines do, and got sold on a trend. Yes, yes, robots.txt. Yes, unobtrusive JavaScript. Yes, structure your DOM in a well-organized, logical manner. Yes, simplify unauthenticated link URLs, and try to correlate references semantically. Yes, use the alt, title and name attributes, to further orient semantics. I get it, okay. Y'know, these same ideas overlap well-enough with accessibility standards. Anything beyond this kind of coding practice is really either link spam, or simple tasks like requesting that a search engine crawl your domain. And that's a marketing campaign. Nothing is being optimized. Can I stop putting this archaic buzzword on my resume? I don't optimize search engines, and unless you're posting an ad for a position at one, neither do you.

But the great things about SE are i) strict moderation ii) limited, clear, scope iii) separated meta Some of that can be helped by the software, but most of it comes from human involvement. I'm still not sure how the new software will ease the problems that forums face. i) Web searching a problem returns a hit for a forum. I visit the forum, to see someone asking my question, and someone else saying \"Search the web, noob\". ii) People just love feeding trolls. It's trivially easy for trolls to disrupt forums. iii) Vested_Contributors - forums have rules. New users get punished for not following the rules; long term users have people making excuses for them (\"It's Bob! Everyone knows Bob! And he makes great posts normally, so let him off this time!\"). iv) Signal : Noise - and this is made worse by having limited number of posts per page. A 29 page thread, with many people saying \"Wow, great!!!\" is a sucky experience. Especially since most forum search software really sucks.",

    "text": "To dominate a radio spectrum usualy ends up with who has the strongest transmitter. BUT in todays digital age and more refined tunning of radio's into more decimal places. Then I believe the following approach would be the best approach for less power. Pick your target spectrum range, Then using a highpower transmitter higher powered than the other as above to do a very granular spectrum hopping around the spectrum but at least transmitting on every channel within that spectrum at a period of frequency that would be greater than normal error corrected interferance by that your signal would then cover the spectrum range alocated but instead of having to do a wide band of the entire spectrum you are picking channels (by channels I mean frequency range that is not interfeared with by either side as you can have a transmission on wifi say that is on channel 3 and can be picked up faintly if your on channel 1, bad example but you should follow what I'm meaning by channel in this case of a spectrum block) at a time interval that would exceed error correction and as such rendering others use of the channel extreemly hard and with that all channels in the defined frequency range, aka spectrum. Now by doing that you would need the least amount of power to block others use of that spectrum and at the same time have a very wide albeit spectrum hopping chunk of bandwith to use and abuse and the faster you make the spectrum hopping to break error handerling of others trying to use that range. Of course with that approach you would have details to work on like frequency channels and how granular you defined those and also the level of error correction you wish to defeat. Remember if you want to compete with others digital transmissions then this is great BUT with analogue it may very well be a case that somebody talking would still be understandable with the level of interfearance. A look at signal type and how it would be analoguely(sic) interpreted is one aspect that may effect how you encode your data as you may end up disrupting the receaving speaker enough to impeede the other signals sound transmision. There is also the aspect of how long you stay on a channel at certain frequencies with some needing longer than others to transmit something usable and the fun of recieving the signal out of step as different frequencies propergate(travel) at different rates(speed) so that would cause out of step reception, though easily countered if your aware of that design aspect. NOW there is a far far easier way and sadly I don't think it is what I would calla hacker approach and is more the script-kiddie solution. That would be to send a silly large pulse on the frequency so strong that it blows all the transmitters. Now you would need to inform your chaps ahead so they could switch of and fold there areils in half type of thing ahead of your radio nuke or more a radio DOS attack. Then they could setup ready afterwards and you would of blown all other recievers and with that the only people who can listern are those you want to listern. Not elegant, but certainly a partial solution that would be cheap to implement as it is that crude, hence not what I call a pure hacker solution. I also suspect the amount of power to do this would exceed the prize money being offered, so you would be pushed and indeed insane to build and test such an approach.",

They aren't offering a guide for tricking anything, they're offering a guide about how to properly structure your site so that it is easily crawlable and identifiable by their spiders so searchers can query for what you have to offer. The core purpose of SEO is to do exactly what you said here: \"The whole premise of the open web is that natural selection would allow rich information to be filtered through because it is good.\" It's called Search Engine OPTIMIZATION for a reason. The goal is to build very well structured sites by following specific sets of best practices. Sure, there are lots of spammers out there. But just like a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn't necessarily a square, a spammer is an SEO but an SEO isn't necessarily a spammer.

    "text": "1. Are you confusing SEO for visibility? SEO == Search Engine Optimization. Google, Bing, and Yahoo didn't even crack 0.5% of your referral sites. If you're not getting traffic from search engines then you're not optimized and ranking for stuff when someone searches. That has nothing to do with the technical stuff like tags and more to do with the actual content. Looking at the data you provide, Hacker News accounts for almost 1/2 your visits, 1/4 on Twitter, then everything else. (BTW, you don't have % of NEW visits in your post which is a more interesting number to read.) The half life of content on Twitter is 3 hours ( http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/ ) which means you're only really visible for, at best, 1 day. Promotion on Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are great but, if I were a writer, I would want to see long-term visibility to new readers where I'm NOT promoting yourself. ... Like Google searches. Assume people are looking to compare Techstars with something else. The #1 search, according to Google Instant search, for \"techstars vs (something)\" is \"techstars vs y combinator\" If your post \"Given The Opportunity: Should You Do TechStars or YC\" showed up on the first page of Google then I would say you've been able to achieve great visibility without SEO. ..... But you don't even show up in the first 5 pages. So, I think you've confused Search Engine Optimization with visibility. (common mistake, actually) ------------ Let's look at your data.... You didn't analyse or provide any insight, which is what I think people should DO with data. (Full disclosure: I'm work in the analytics department for my company. I research and write code to answer these kinds of questions for clients) 2. Are people actually reading your blog? It says currently that the average pages per visit is about 2 and they're spending 0:52 seconds on your blog. The average adult reads 250-300 words every minute. ( http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy ) At a glance you average 150-200 word posts. Does that mean they're only reading half of the second page they go to (What is the time on page for second page?) What is the second page? Is it the home page or another blog post? The data you provide doesn't help to answer that. You didn't mention your \"% of Exits\". A bounce rate, by definition, is always visits that only visited one page and left. Therefore, \"% of Bounce rate\" isn't a good metric to look at for you because your average pages per visit is over 1. \"% of Exits\" sorted by the URL of the page would give you insight into your readers. If your \"% of Exits\" on your home page is really high, then it may mean your readers aren't finding anything interesting to read. Conversely, if the \"% of Exits\" is usually a blog post, that's OK, especially if it's their second page, it means they may have read two posts then left. ------------ 3. Are you gaining new readers / are old readers coming back? You said that the percentage of new visits is 70%. Over the past year is that increasing, decreasing, or going all over the place? What about \"% of returning visits?\" If you're trying to go after new readers, great job. I would think making sure they return for more later is also important. I don't think you really want to be a one hit wonder. ------------ 4. Are your readers subscribing to your mailing list? It's on the right side of every page, so I'm guessing you want to make sure people notice it. Nobody wants spam, so if they subscribe you're almost guaranteed they like what you're writing. Are visitors subscribing to your mailing list? Is that number increasing? It's a good thing if they are.",

    "text": "It seems that to do shenanigans with Bitcoin would require the same care to avoid information leakage that would be required to do similar things with global digital payment networks and banks. The key would be to begin by considering any address linked to an identity that is you or related to you \"dirty,\" and to be careful about avoiding linkage to any of those dirty addresses. To really be careful I think you'd have to delve into graph theory and data mining a bit yourself, or follow the precautions of someone who knows what they're talking about. You'd also have to take care to pay attention to network addresses under the protocol, using Tor or similar proxying systems and considering any address that's been used from an IP that can be linked to you similarly \"dirty.\" Use of VPSes that accept anonymous payment would also be an option, though again... don't SSH to them from your house! Use Tor or smurf the data around by way of proxies and drop sites and such. Laundering money would require extreme caution to avoid such contamination, and would present many of the same challenges as money laundering in the fiat currency world. BTC/fiat conversions would be very risky. In-person BTC/fiat conversions are vulnerable to old fashioned gumshoe police work: \"hey, that BTC you exchanged on localbitcoin... you happen to remember what that guy looked like?\" These are also only feasible for small quantities. Large quantities would present a huge challenge. What this really means is that Bitcoin is not intrinsically an instrument for villainy as some lazy press articles make it out to be. In fact, criminal use of Bitcoin requires orders of magnitude more technical sophistication, which the vast majority of criminals do not have. A highly educated or sophisticated criminal or intelligence network could surely pull off shenanigans with Bitcoin, but I doubt your average thug or child porn wanker is going to even comprehend the stuff I wrote above. So at the very least, Bitcoin is only a criminal tool for very geeky high-IQ criminals.",

Another example, and the one that inspired me, was one of the bloggers mentioned earlier. Patrick McKenzie runs a small, online business selling bingo cards to teachers (he sold over $45,000 worth of bingo cards in 2011). One thing Patrick does really well is search engine optimization (SEO). One of his techniques for getting people to link to his site (a big part of a high Google ranking), involves open source software. “What!?” That might be your reaction right now. What does open source software have to do with bingo cards for 1st graders? The answer is nothing. However, Patrick is a software developer that wrote the code for his bingo card website. He recognized that some of the code he wrote was valuable all on its own. So he turned part of it into an open source Ruby on Rails project, put the code up on his site along with instructions on using it, and then told the world about it. What happened? All sorts of software developers, with no interest in bingo cards but a huge interest in his software, started linking to the portion of Patrick’s website that hosted this open source project. More links to his website meant a better ranking on Google which meant more sales of his bingo card creator. So while he didn’t directly sell his offering the way Amazon sold their’s, he did use it in a way that created more business for him.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure that this Mpemba Effect is folklore. The hot water must necessarily pass through the temperature that the cooler water starts at. In fact if we are to believe this than at some point the initially hot water and the initially cold water must, at some point, be the same (average) temperature. Why then would it start to cool faster? Options that I can think of 1) initially hot water cools very asymmetrically so some hot portion gives of heat (to the air!) faster 2) more rapid temperature change sets up strong convective currents that, because of momentum, stay around, causing the initially hot water to give up heat faster. These both seem very unlikely. Fluid water is a very good heat conductor (and air a good insulator) making it unlikely that there would be significant temperature gradients and intuition tells us that freezing water takes much longer than it takes any sort of current to die down. (also note that these two effects would act to cancel each other out) As for the reasons mentioned in the wikipedia article: 1)Definition of frozen: I suppose that this could account for the effect if you measured the time for cold water to completely freeze and hot water to reach 0 degrees C! But in general as long as you use the same metric this won't matter 2) Evaporation (reducing the volume to be frozen): So an initially hot fluid will evaporate more and I suppose result in a slightly smaller volume to freeze. Since the thermal mass is proportional volume and the heat transfer is proportional to area this is a real effect. However the % change in volume of any reasonable shape of water is so insignificant compared to the difference in energy of hot water and cold water that this effect is almost certainly negligible. (perhaps if the claim was hot water freezes faster than cold water if it is laid out in very very very thin sheets I would buy it because of this.) 3) Convection: see above. 4) Frost: Since the water must pass through the same temperature (0 C) for frost to start to build the frost must grow differently on initially hot water than initially cold. I really see no reason to believe this is the case 5)Super cooling: again, if the convective forces persist for a mush longer time than seems reasonable... 6) Solutes and dissolved gases: I mean if one fluid is a different chemical composition than the other then I suppose all bets are off, but I feel the claim of \"warmer water freezes faster than colder water\" implies they are both the same substance However the main reason I believe this to be an Urban Myth is that it makes such a good story. It fits our belief as a culture that there are weird things about science that we don't understand and it challenges our initial intuition in a memorable way. In addition it requires more effort to test than most of us are willing to put forth (including me: I would be very interested if someone would actually do the test recommended in the wikipedia article.) Lastly; hot water freezing faster is a much better story than the other way around. Telling people that hot water freezes faster makes you seem to have some kind of secret knowledge; a spell you can cast over ice cube trays to make them into ice faster. I bet a reasonable rule for judging truth is that, all else being equal, the better story is less likely to be the true one, because if the truth was also the better story then no one would tell the boring one.",

    "text": "No doubt, there are plenty of cases when medication is the right option. However, there are many more cases where it's not. How we do psychology? We take a bunch of symptoms that seem to coincide with a group of individuals and we label it as a disorder : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd#DSM-IV_criteria The fact that these symptoms exist and cause problems for many individuals is of no question - that's why we have a \"disorder\" label associated with it. There is no dispute that medication is effective in treating these symptoms, either. However, the claim that medication \"even more effective\" is flimsy, if not flat out wrong. The problem is that there are many more studies devoted to the \"effects of ritalin on ADHD\" than there are to the \"effects of exercise and ADHD.\" Or meditation, or biofeedback, or eating 7 lbs of celery a day, or whatever. To make the claim that \"drugs are more effective\" is easier because studies of this nature are more prevalent - but it doesn't make it right. That would be a total confirmation bias. A difficulty in comparing medication to other methods is that medication = instant gratification and instant results. You eat a pill. A half hour later, you are focused, less scattered and more attentive. In the similar way to how coffee wakes you up if you are tired. It's easy to make an experiment out of such results. Exercise, in contrast, isn't instant. Exercise increases levels of nor-epinephrine and dopamine... but not nearly as rapidly (or with as little work) as an amphetamine compound. Steady and healthy levels of serotonin (which is now being studied as another player in the ADHD game) don't begin to rise until weeks of daily exercising. It may be slower, but our bodies are capable of changing, and for quantities of any given chemical being pumped out to increase, you need to keep doing things that keep causing it to be released. You need to form habits that make your body more effective at producing it's own chemical cocktails. Take a basic course in human physiology or neuroscience if you don't believe how amazing and capable our bodies and brains are at adapting and improving. Furthermore, a disorder label can easily be misconstrued by a young individual with ADHD. They might think to themselves, \"Wow, finally, a word to describe all the problems I'm having. It's not my fault after all, I'm sick, and I need medicine.\" It sucks because instead of really trying to go beyond the condition by using their will, they may give up and go the route of altering their minds externally - just to keep up with their peers. Is that a bad thing? Well, I'll leave that up to the reader. It is my personal opinion that that overcoming challenges of ADHD is not only possible through other, healthier methods (exercise, meditation and learning/coping strategies), but is more rewarding as well (speaking from personal experience). However, no one can do this by themselves - and it sucks that some people do not have the support, and that schools don't have a 15 minute exercise break every 3 hours, and that they don't let you eat snacks in class, and that we are constantly exposed to electronic stimulation from a very young age, that some of us don't learn how to control our intake of these things. Television, video games and other forms of electronic stimulation have been proven to release dopamine (Jeez, what doesn't?). A person with ADHD can easily focus to a show on TV with quickly changing camera angles, loud sounds, constant dialogue and continuous novelty. We grew up with this. But, when we are in class, we fidget, and daydream and blurt things out because this stimulation is not present, so our bodies are attempting to mitigate the dopamine withdrawal through the constant production of activity, of both the mind and the body. Finally, Ritalin hasn't been studied for 70 years. It's been about 40. It didn't start being used for ADHD until The late 60s, and wasn't in widespread use until the 90s - which is when the more serious studies began to come out. There's much more to say, but I'm getting tired :) Sources: http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-03-26-adhd-treatmen... http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041220013546.ht... http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565830",

Part of the SEO on one site I worked on was to optimise to ensure it was better geo-targetted, ie decrease the visitor count from jurisdictions where that site is not valid. Why?

I do things like name URLs for the content they contain, not /item?id=887743 but /why-not-to-hire-an-SEO - letting people know the content of a link before they click it; evil I guess? Then there's optimising for speed to improve user retention, gzip enabling, trimming needless scripts and CSS, ... (WW looks like it could be leaner). I consider this part of \"SEO\".

However the real barrier to this stuff being really useful is the frequency and granularity of updates. The thing that geo-location brings, the thing that we really want is serendipity. It massively increases the chance of meeting a friend while out because your devices know you are a block (or a foot) away even if you don't. This means that our ability to encounter serendipity is exponentially increased because it's no longer limited by our senses or memories. Dodgeball would introduce friends of friends, for example. The problem remains, until geo-location is automatic and effortless the cost and frequency of updates belies the effort.",

    "text": "Most of the criticism (I think) revolves around the methodology being biased towards unambitious projects. The economists were asked to rank proposals according to how much good they would do in alleviating existing world problems. The premise is a limited budget roughly based on 'aid budgets'. I think climate change should have been left outside of what they were looking at altogether for lots of reasons. The projects are too uncertain to be ranked. Putting an extra $1b towards existing climate change projects may result in absolutely no effect on climate change. We are talking about risky, expensive projects. An economist doesn't really know if a propaganda campaign to convince americans or Chinese to sign some deal is better then some geo-engineering technology project to directly cool the earth. It is outside the realm of what smart economists are good at. - It is coming out of different pockets. Climate change affects rich countries too. It is self interested spending. Certainly, there are tragedy of the commons like problems. But it is still in the interest of those spending to spend. - The effects of climate change are uncertain and indirect. One of the potential climate change issues is decreased glacial melt in India resulting in less summer river flows in to Pakistan. India is entitled (by treaty) to a fixed (in litres) amount of water. Pakistan needs this water to grow food without which it will be in famine. This could result in, mass refuge crisis, nuclear war, etc. It is virtually impossible to link something like that directly to an increase or decrease of $500m in spending by some NGO. *But... If you are a millionaire or in charge of an NGO or a foreign spending budget or give money to a poverty related charity, the Copenhagen Consensus seems like an important list to consider. If decide to act against its recommendations, at least have a reason.",

My best example of success in a Q and A site is College Confidential. http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/ It isn't perfect, but it is chock full of information about the college admission process, and its online atmosphere of politeness and regard for other users' questions readily differentiates it from most other competitors running sites on the same subject.
