    "text": "The Search Landscape Has Fundamentally Changed In the span of just two years, how people find information has undergone a transformation more dramatic than the shift from Yellow Pages to Google. The rise of AI answer engines—ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Microsoft’s Copilot—has created a new paradigm for content discovery. Welcome to the era of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). For two decades, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) followed a familiar playbook: target keywords, build backlinks, optimize metadata, and climb the rankings. But when a user asks ChatGPT “What’s the best CRM for small businesses?” or queries Perplexity about “enterprise AI implementation strategies,” there are no blue links to optimize for. There’s only the answer—and your brand is either in it, or it’s invisible. This isn’t speculative futurism. According to recent data from HubSpot and Gartner, AI-powered search interactions are projected to handle over 1.5 billion queries daily by mid-2026. For marketers, the implications are stark: traditional SEO tactics alone are becoming insufficient for visibility in an AI-first world.",

    "text": "Microsoft is surviving precisely because of stickiness as you put it. But their users have to use them, and have to pay for it. There are very few people that use openai today that have to pay for it, those forced to use it are typically doing so via free avenues like windows copilot. OpenAI has the stickiness of MSN news or MS Teams. Your wife uses chatgpt on a daily basis but is she paying for it? If they charge her $0.99&#x2F;mo will she not look at alternatives? If she gets two or three bad responses from chatgpt in a row, will she not explore alternatives to see if there is something better? Does she not use google? If she does, she is already interacting with gemini everyday via their AI overview. OpenAI has a first-to-market advantage, not a moat as you think. they can absolutley dominate the market, if they stay on top of their game. Ebay was the main online shopping network, they had that advantage, they were even the ones that made Paypal a thing! But they&#x27;re relatively little used now, better alternatives crushed them. Amazon was the first-to-market with cloud services, they didn&#x27;t get worse in any significant way, but their market share is not as great as it used to be, Azure has gained decent ground on them. 10 years ago the market share break down was 31&#x2F;7&#x2F;4, now it is 28&#x2F;21&#x2F;14 for AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP respectively. For OpenAI to survive it needs most of the market share, if it gets only a 3rd for example, the AI industry on its own needs to be a $1T+ industry. Over the past 10 years revenue alone (not profit) for AWS has been $620B total and just made $128B in revenue (highest) last year. OpenAI needs to make in profits (not revenue) what AWS made last year in revenue by 2029 just to break even. If it manages to just break even by then, it needs to have more profits than the revenue AWS managed to attain after its entire lifetime until now. It&#x27;s far easier to switch LLM models than cloud providers too! Their only remote way of survival, I hate to say it, is by going the way of palantir and doing dirty things for governments and militaries. they need a cash-cow client that can&#x27;t get anyone else like that. And even then, being US-based, I don&#x27;t think outside the US any military is insane enough to use OpenAI at all due to geopolitics. Even in sectors like education, Google (via chromebooks) is more likely to form dependence than Microsoft via OpenAI since somehow they&#x27;re more open to arbitrary apps due to historical anti-trust suits. I can see a somewhat far-fetched argument being made for their survival, but only on thin-threads and excellent execution. But I can&#x27;t see how they can actually survive competition. They&#x27;re using the Azure strategy for market share, they&#x27;re banking on AI being so ubiquitous that existing vendor-lock-in mindset will serve as a moat. They&#x27;ll need to be much more profitable than AWS in like 1&#x2F;5th of the time. Their product is comparable to (and literally is in Azure) one of many cloud service offerings, as oppose to an entire cloud provider, and their costs are huge similar to cloud providers like needing their own data-centers level huge, they need to overcome those costs, and on top of that have $125B&gt; revenue in like 2 years!!",

    "text": "Folks, we’ve all been there... you find a cool Chrome extension, go to install it, and then you see the warning: &quot;This extension can read and change all your data on all websites.&quot; Is it a technical necessity? Or is it a keylogger sending your bank logins to a server in a basement somewhere? Unless you&#x27;re a developer willing to manually download and decompile the .crx file, you’re just guessing. I got tired of that &quot;blind trust&quot; model and built an AI-powered security scanner that goes through the actual code of every extension on the store: ChromeBoard.com. What ChromeBoard Does: - Full Source Code Analysis: We don’t just read the description; we scan the entire codebase. - Plain English Reports: We explain permissions in simple terms. No &quot;trust scores&quot;—just the facts so you can decide. - Network Mapping: We identify every external server your data is sent to. - Flagging Dangerous Patterns: Our AI detects eval(), obfuscation, crypto-mining, and potential keyloggers. - Version Comparisons: See exactly what changed (or what was added) between updates. - Auto-Rescans: We trigger a new scan whenever an extension updates. The Vision: Why this matters Right now, each scan takes about 2 minutes. Why? Because I’m running this entire operation on a single RTX 4090 using a local Qwen3-Coder-30B model. I’m doing this locally because: - Privacy: I refuse to send extension code to some cheap no-privacy third-party AI APIs. - Cost: I can’t afford $50k&#x2F;month in inference fees for 250k+ extensions. The site has only been live for two days, but the goal is to make this the &quot;Carfax&quot; of the Chrome Ecosystem. - For Users: A &quot;check before you install&quot; report that actually makes sense. - For Developers: A way to get &quot;Verified Trust&quot; signals to drive adoption. - For Enterprises: A third-party vetting tool for IT admins to secure their org. The &quot;Ask&quot;: Help me scale this I’ve reached the limit of what a single local GPU can do. I am looking for Cloud AI&#x2F;Inference sponsors to help me move this from &quot;side project speed&quot; to &quot;ecosystem speed.&quot; With the right compute partners, I could scan 1,000x faster, provide real-time alerts when a behavior changes, and open up an API for other security tools. If you represent a cloud provider or AI platform, here is why you want to be the engine behind ChromeBoard: - Massive Visibility: Your brand on every security report (&quot;Powered by...&quot;). - High Volume: A sustained, high-integrity API flow through your stack. - The &quot;Good Guy&quot; Factor: You’re helping secure the browsers of millions of people. I’m just one dev who got tired of clicking &quot;Install&quot; and praying. If you’re a dev, an admin, or just hate malware, check out the site and let me know: Which extension should I scan next? Check it out: ChromeBoard.com",

I use chrome-based browsers usually (I also hate how dependent I have become on Google; default firefox refuses to play audio on my linux system as they claim we need pulseaudio, chrome instead makes no such assumption and audio plays just fine, so one can go and figure out why mozilla acts worse than Google here - all the google-bribe money killed its THINKING ability), so when I do, I use a few extensions such as &quot;disable AI overview&quot; or similar. It is annoying that we have to invest time in order to uncripple the world wide web. Browser vendors should be much more responsible, from the get go. But they all want to jump on the hype train, to milk out more money. Greed is the driving theme nowadays. (They could offer AI based on people who want or need that, rather than cram it down onto everyone.)",

Each task runs in a single agent context (one responsibility, clear scope), and when the window fills up, the system automatically rotates: writes a structured handover, clears, and resumes in a fresh window. The key distinction: sub-agents run within a parent context with shared state (black box). My approach uses independent parallel agents (separate terminals, separate context windows) that report back to an orchestrator. Large tasks get split into smaller dispatches upfront — each scoped to fit a single context window. The orchestrator can dispatch research to 3 agents in parallel, collect their outputs, then dispatch a synthesis task to a single agent that merges the findings. So it&#x27;s not &quot;one context window for everything&quot; — it&#x27;s right-sized tasks with full observability per agent, and a governance layer managing the sequence and merging results.",

As a parent I would the be able to setup my child device however I wish without loss of privacy. Is it bypassable by a sufficiently determined child? Yes, but so it is the current age verification nonsense.",

Or, if you&#x27;re so inclined: think about how having this in the US would mean Trump would be authorizing bot armies.

For age verification specifically, the only information that services need proof of is that the users age is above a certain threshold. i.e. that the user is 14 years or older. But in order to make this determination, we see services asking for government ID (which many 14-year-olds do not have), or for invasive face scans. These methods provide far more data than necessary. What the service needs to &quot;prove&quot; in this case is three things: 1. that the user meets the age predicate 2. that the identity used to meet the age predicate is validated by some authority 3. that the identity is not being reused across many accounts All the technologies exist for this, we just haven&#x27;t put them together usefully. Zero knowledge proofs, like Groth16 or STARKs allow for statements about data to be validated externally without revealing the data itself. These are difficult for engineers to use, let alone consumers. Big opportunity for someone to build an authority here.",

Getting hung up on unlinkable sessions is missing the forest for the trees. At this point I think the challenge has less to do with the crypto primitives and more to do with building infrastructure that hides 100% of the complexity of identity validation from users. My state already has a gov&#x27;t ID that can be added to an apple wallet.

What you&#x27;re hearing then isn&#x27;t &quot;astro-turfing&quot; but one coalition, of potentially many. I often hear people terrified that the government will have a say on what they view online, while being just fine with google doing the same. You can agree or disagree with my assesment, but the point is that hearing that point a bunch doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s google astroturfing. It just means there&#x27;s an ideology out there that thinks it&#x27;s different (and more opressive seemingly) when governments do it. It means all those people have a similar opinion, probably from reading the same blogs.",

That kind of thinking is just what got Trump to the Whitehouse, and is currently getting the immigrants rounded up. Things that didn&#x27;t seem likely to have broad support previously, now are seen as acceptable. In the 90&#x27;s no one could envision rounding up immigrants. No one could envision uploading an ID card to use ICQ. No one could envision the concept of DE-naturalization or getting rid of birthright citizenship. Today, in the US for instance, there are entire new generations of people alive. And many, many people who were alive in the 90&#x27;s are gone. Well these new people very much can envision these things. And they seem to have stocked the Supreme Court to make all these kinds of things a reality. All because the rest of us keep dismissing all of this as just harmless extreme positions that no one in society really supports.

There are many powerful interests that support this model: - Governments benefit from easier monitoring and enforcement. - The advertising industry prefers verified identities for better targeting. - Social media companies gain more reliable data and engagement. - Online shopping companies can reduce fraud and increase tracking. - Many SaaS companies would also welcome stronger identity verification. In short, anonymity is not very profitable, and governments often favor identification because it increases oversight and control. Of course, this leads to political debate. Some point out that voting often does not require ID, while accessing online services does. The usual argument is that voting is a constitutional right. However, one could argue that access to the internet has become a fundamental part of modern life as well. It may not be explicitly written into the Constitution, but in practice it functions as an essential right in today’s society.",

By the way: the owners of the &quot;well-known&quot; beverage shops made their own rules, which were in some sense more strict, but in other ways less strict than the laws: For example some small shop in Germany sold beverages with little alcohol to basically everybody who did not look suspicious, but was insanely strict on selling cigarettes: even if the buyer was sufficiently old (which was in doubt strictly checked), the owner made serious attempts to refuse selling cigarettes if he had the slightest suspicion that the cigarettes were actually bought for some younger person. In other words: if you attempted to buy cigarettes, you were treated like a suspect if the owner knew that you had younger friends (and the owner knew this very well).",

Just checking on launch or focus resolves that problem. It&#x27;s no longer the account being verified per se, it&#x27;s the account and the use.",

We&#x27;re headed down the path of age verification because we know now that not only is social media harmful, it&#x27;s especially harmful to kids, and has been specifically targeted to them.

They are cognitively defective.

    "text": "I run multiple content-heavy sites and got tired of one thing: there was no deterministic way to validate with the AI agent whether my content was actually optimized. Not &quot;probably fine&quot; — actually checked against concrete rules, both for traditional search and for AI search engines. SEO linters exist, but they&#x27;re either paid SaaS, not automatable, or ignore the structural patterns that LLMs use when deciding what to cite. So I built one. geo-lint is a CLI with 92 rules: 32 SEO (table stakes — titles, descriptions, headings, slugs, canonical URLs, schema, the works), 35 GEO rules specifically for AI citation readiness, 14 content quality checks inspired by Yoast, and the rest for technical and i18n validation. We extensively researched the current state of GEO and AEO to make sure the rules reflect what actually gets content cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews — not outdated advice. The design principle: the linter is deterministic, the AI agent is creative. Same content in, same violations out, every time. The agent does the fixing. In practice, I install it in a project, paste one prompt into Claude Code or Cursor: Run npx geo-lint --format=json, fix every violation using the suggestion field, re-run until the output is []. And walk away. The agent reads the JSON violations, edits the files, re-lints, loops — no manual input. When it finishes, the content is validated for both traditional search ranking and AI citation. One command, both outcomes, across an entire site. Every rule outputs a machine-readable suggestion field that tells the agent exactly what to change. The JSON has no formatting, no ANSI colors — pure structured data. Works with Markdown&#x2F;MDX out of the box, extensible to Astro, HTML, or any CMS via custom adapters. This is extracted from the toolchain I use on production client content at my agency. MIT licensed, zero peer dependencies, TypeScript. Happy to answer questions about GEO patterns, what makes content citable by LLMs, or how the agentic loop works in practice.",

    "text": "Tesla claims that their cameras use &quot;photon counting&quot; and that this lets them see well in the dark, in fog, in heavy rain, and when facing bright lights like the sun. Photon counting is a real thing [1] but that&#x27;s not what Tesla claims to be doing. I cannot tell if what they are doing is something actually effective that they should have called something other than &quot;photon counting&quot; or just the usual Musk exaggerations. Anyone here familiar with the relevant fields who can say which it is? Here&#x27;s what they claim, as summarized by whatever it is Google uses for their &quot;AI Overview&quot;. &gt; Tesla photon counting is an advanced, raw-data approach to camera imaging for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), where sensors detect and count individual light particles (photons) rather than processing aggregate image intensity. By removing traditional image processing filters and directly passing raw pixel data to neural networks, Tesla improves dynamic range, enabling better vision in low light and high-contrast scenarios. It says these are the key aspects: &gt; Direct Data Processing: Instead of relying on image signal processors (ISPs) to create a human-friendly picture, Tesla feeds raw sensor data directly into the neural network, allowing the system to detect subtle light variations and near-IR (infrared) light. &gt; Improved Dynamic Range: This approach allows the system to see in the dark exceptionally well by not losing information to standard image compression or exposure adjustments. &gt; Increased Sensitivity: By operating at the single-photon level, the system achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio, effectively &quot;seeing in the dark&quot;. &gt; Elimination of Exposure Limitations: The technique helps mitigate issues like sun glare, allowing for better visibility in extreme lighting conditions. &gt; Neural Network Training: The raw, unfiltered data is used to train Tesla&#x27;s neural networks, allowing for more robust, high-fidelity perception in complex, real-world driving environments.

While 50 meters is a very short distance, the car must be present at the car wash to be cleaned, according to LinkedIn users [1]. Walking would leave your car at home, defeating the purpose of the trip, notes another user. Why Drive: The car needs to be at the location to be cleaned. It&#x27;s only a few seconds away, and you can simply drive it there and back, says a Hacker News user. [2] Why Not to Walk: Walking there means the car stays home, as noted in a post. [3] The best option is to start the engine, drive the 50 meters, and let the car get washed. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ramar_i-saw-this-llm-failure-...

Washing a car usually requires, well, the car to be at the wash. Walking 50 meters—about half a New York City block—is great for your step count, but it won&#x27;t get your vehicle any cleaner!

Run your content into its input jacks, but instead of cabling the VCR directly to an analogue TV, use its RF output fed into an antenna, and use the analogue TV&#x27;s tuner to receive. On most North American VCRs, that would mean selecting either output channel 3 or 4. For larger coverage areas, cut two dipole antennas to the appropriate size for the selected channel (one antenna for TX, one for RX). If you were to put a low noise VHF-LO amp inline between the VCR output and the TX antenna, you&#x27;d be able to cover a much larger area, but would probably have legal issues with governmental authorities in charge of telecommunication spectrum.",

    "text": "I don’t think you’re missing anything. The hype cycle is real. But I also don’t think the signal is zero. It’s just buried under capital and compute flexing. The pattern I see isn’t AI is revolutionary. It’s: 1) The easy wins are done. 2) The marginal gains are getting expensive. 3) The distribution layer is shifting faster than the capability layer. Most new model releases aren’t unlocking fundamentally new workflows. They’re compressing friction in workflows that already work. That’s useful, but not narrative-worthy. The real shift isn’t GPT-5.3 vs GPT-5.2. It’s: - AI replacing search as the interface layer. - AI compressing junior-level execution work. - AI reshaping how products are discovered (AI Overviews, summaries, agents). That doesn’t make MoltBook any less absurd. Burning compute on bots talking to bots is peak theater. But dismissing everything because of the theater might be like dismissing the internet because of Pets.com. We may be at peak hype, but that doesn’t mean the substrate shift isn’t real. The question isn’t, is AI overhyped? It’s, where is durable value forming? That’s harder, and way less viral, to answer.",

    "text": "I’m building an AI search optimization product and wanted to apply the same principles internally: fix content architecture before launch instead of correcting problems after users — or AI systems — struggle to understand it. To do this, I created a Python CLI tool that analyzes semantic structure using vector embeddings. It parses markdown files, generates embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI), computes cosine similarity, runs k-means clustering, detects redundancy and semantic gaps, and produces visualizations like heatmaps, dendrograms, and UMAP projections. The stack includes Python 3.12, sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, UMAP, and Plotly, with embedding caching for speed. Analysis Overview: The site contains 25 pages (~12.9k words) across features, concepts, use cases, and resources. No stub pages were found. Topic coherence (measured via average similarity between sections) ranged from 0.73 to 0.93, with most pages between 0.78–0.88. Lower coherence wasn’t necessarily bad — the Proof Engine page scored lower because it intentionally covers many subtopics. Semantic redundancy showed only one pair above 0.85 similarity, both intentional cross-link sections. Earlier, I removed two index pages with 85%+ similarity to parent pages, flattening navigation from three layers to two. No semantic gaps were detected; all pages were well connected. Hub analysis confirmed that Home, Learn, and the AEO Playbook act as central nodes, matching the intended architecture of concepts → applications → tools. Heatmap clustering revealed: * Concept pages: 0.65–0.80 similarity * Feature pages: 0.45–0.65 similarity * Use cases: 0.70–0.79 similarity Embeddings were chosen over keyword analysis because they capture meaning rather than wording, detecting paraphrased overlap and relationships relevant to AI retrieval systems. Limitations include model sensitivity, arbitrary cluster counts, and coherence scores that don’t fully account for intentional structure. Planned improvements include entity coverage analysis, competitor comparisons, and query-simulation testing. The entire process took under a minute but prevented structural issues that could cause discoverability problems later. Running semantic analysis pre-launch helped validate architecture, reduce duplication, and ensure content works for both humans and AI retrieval systems.",

We&#x27;ve been tracking this &quot;AI visibility&quot; metric internally too (using a mix of prompt injection and search monitoring) and found that brand mentions correlate strongly with structured data quality and entity clarity, rather than traditional backlinks. It seems like LLMs prioritize &quot;authoritative entities&quot; over &quot;keyword-optimized pages&quot;. For example, if you&#x27;re cited in authoritative industry reports or have a clear Knowledge Graph entity, you&#x27;re much more likely to be recommended. One interesting thing we&#x27;ve noticed: different models have distinct &quot;personalities&quot; in recommendations.

GEO tools do not inject prompts or control inference. They systematically reshape the external content corpus from which large language models synthesize answers. When AI-generated representations are materially relied upon in regulated decisions, this practice creates an evidentiary gap: outcomes can influence judgment without producing reconstructable, auditable records explaining why those outcomes prevailed. This is not a claim of illegality. It is a governance lag.",

Each one contains the framework references, quality rules, and logic required to generate professional-grade output without the typical &quot;AI fluff.&quot; The core philosophy here is &quot;No Fluff.&quot; I’ve hard-coded rules into the system instructions to prevent the &quot;As an AI language model...&quot; intros and the &quot;I hope this helps!&quot; outros. It goes straight to the substantive content. Each Skill is a single Markdown file. I use Markdown because LLMs parse the hierarchy of headers and bullet points better than flat text. The prompts are designed to be &quot;context-aware,&quot; meaning they infer whether the business is B2B or B2C based on the initial brief without requiring manual toggles. The library is organized by function: STRATEGY Buyer Persona: 400+ line personas with 10 psychological sections. Market Positioning: Competitive alternatives and SWOT frameworks. Value Proposition: Feature -&gt; Capability -&gt; Benefit -&gt; Outcome ladders. GTM Strategy: Full plans including channels and timelines. ADVERTISING Google&#x2F;Meta Campaigns: Complete with hook formulas and audience specs. Ad Copy: 15+ variations using psychological triggers. A&#x2F;B Testing: Structured hypothesis and measurement frameworks. CONTENT &amp; SEO LLM Optimization: Strategies for visibility in AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity). SEO Strategy: Keyword research and link-building plans. Content Strategy: Pillar-cluster models with editorial calendars. COPY &amp; WEBSITE Landing Pages: Using StoryBrand and PAS frameworks. Headlines: 20+ variations using AIDA and PAS formulas. Homepage Audit: Conversion optimization with prioritized fixes. SALES &amp; EMAIL Email Sequences: 5-10 stage nurture flows with subject A&#x2F;B variants. Sales Scripts: Discovery, demo, and objection handling. HOW TO USE: Download the .md file for a skill (maestrix.ai&#x2F;skills). Upload it to Claude (via Projects or the Skills capability). Provide your basic business info. The system triggers the logic automatically.",

    "text": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m the creator of LocalPDF ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localpdf.online ) — a privacy-first PDF toolkit that works entirely in your browser. I wanted to share something fascinating: ChatGPT has become my biggest traffic source, accounting for ~50% of visitors, compared to ~45% from Google. This happened organically — I didn&#x27;t optimize specifically for AI assistants. Key Stats: - ChatGPT: ~50% of traffic - Google Search: ~45% - Direct&#x2F;Other: ~5% - Conversion rate from ChatGPT: 2x higher than Google - ChatGPT users stay 40% longer on average What I think is happening: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) vs SEO Traditional SEO focuses on keywords, backlinks, and content clusters. But AI assistants work differently: - They parse semantic HTML structure - They value clear, descriptive content over keyword density - They prefer sites that solve problems directly The ironic part? My site was built with basic semantic HTML and clear descriptions — not because I was targeting AI, but because it&#x27;s good web development practice. Technical Details: - Stack: Astro + TypeScript, client-side PDF.js - No tracking, no uploads — everything processes locally - Semantic HTML: proper headings, landmarks, meta descriptions - Clear tool descriptions with use cases Why ChatGPT users convert better: 1. Intent clarity: They ask specific questions (&quot;how to compress PDF without losing quality&quot;) 2. Contextual recommendations: ChatGPT explains why LocalPDF fits their needs 3. Trust transfer: AI assistant endorsement acts as social proof Limitations: - Can&#x27;t track which specific ChatGPT prompts drive traffic - No direct way to optimize for AI recommendations - ChatGPT&#x27;s recommendations can change unpredictably Questions for HN: 1. Are you seeing similar traffic patterns from AI assistants? 2. How do you measure&#x2F;optimize for GEO vs traditional SEO? 3. What happens when every AI assistant has different ranking criteria? This feels like early Google days — there&#x27;s a level playing field where good products with clear value propositions can get discovered organically, without massive SEO budgets. Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, traffic patterns, or anything else!",

    "text": "I’m one of the researchers at Aurascape Aura Labs who worked on this. We’ve been investigating a real‑world campaign where scammers seed GEO&#x2F;AEO‑optimized content across the web so that LLM‑powered answer engines (Perplexity, Google AI Overview, etc.) surface fraudulent “customer support” phone numbers as if they were official airline lines. A few things we found: Perplexity answers queries like “the official Emirates Airlines reservations number” or “how can I make a reservation with British Airways by phone” with step‑by‑step instructions that prominently include a scam call‑center number. Google’s AI Overview has, in some cases, recommended the same ecosystem of fake numbers for Emirates reservations in the US. The numbers are backed by a lot of poisoned content: PDFs on compromised .gov&#x2F;.edu&#x2F;WordPress sites, MapMyRun route pages hosting uploaded spam PDFs, bot‑generated Yelp reviews, and YouTube channels where titles&#x2F;descriptions are stuffed with airline keywords and phone numbers. Even when ChatGPT or Claude return the correct number, their citations sometimes include these poisoned sources, which suggests the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is already influencing the retrieval layer across multiple models. From our perspective this isn’t a jailbreak or prompt‑injection problem so much as a new LLM index poisoning &#x2F; answer‑engine optimization issue: attackers are optimizing content specifically to be retrieved, trusted, and summarized by generative systems. The post includes: concrete screenshots for Perplexity and Google AI Overview an explanation of how the GEO&#x2F;AEO spam is structured a non‑exhaustive list of indicators of compromise (phone numbers + abused hosts) some mitigation ideas for LLM vendors, brands, and platforms like YouTube&#x2F;Yelp Feedback very welcome — especially from people working on LLM retrieval&#x2F;ranking, safety, or abuse detection. Happy to clarify any part of the methodology or data.",

    "text": "Hi HN, I’ve been experimenting with how large language models surface products, companies, and information inside generated answers — and built a tool called AISee to measure this more systematically. I wanted to share it here in case others are exploring similar questions. Problem As AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) become discovery channels, many teams started noticing something odd: Their website ranks fine on Google But AI systems don’t mention them Or worse, describe them inaccurately Or mention competitors instead This isn’t visible in traditional SEO analytics, and manually prompting each AI engine doesn’t scale or stay consistent. The question that drove this project was: “How exactly does each AI system represent a given brand or product across different queries, and how does that change over time?” What AISee Does AISee runs structured queries across multiple AI engines and captures: whether a brand appears how often it appears in what context which competitors appear instead how consistent the descriptions are whether key product attributes are missing or wrong It then computes an “AI presence” score and highlights inconsistent or outdated information. No marketing layer, no growth hacks — just visibility and representation data. Why This Matters LLMs compress what used to be an entire SERP into a single aggregated answer. That means: fewer brands get surfaced category winners are amplified outdated model knowledge lingers and LLM “ranking behavior” varies significantly by platform For anyone working on search, ranking, NLP, entity integrity, or recommendation systems, this offers an interesting new space to study. Implementation Details A few notes about how it works under the hood: Query sets are generated using a structured taxonomy (category → intent → modifier) Responses are parsed through a semantic extraction layer (entity detection, attribute matching, competitor identification) We track deltas over time to detect model drift or knowledge shifts No scraping of proprietary content — only model outputs The system is event-driven, and each AI engine is queried via its public API or UI automation depending on platform availability I’m especially interested in improving the consistency detection and competitor graph. What I’m Looking for I’m hoping to hear from: People working on AI search &#x2F; LLM ranking transparency Anyone studying how LLMs internalize and surface entities Teams who have seen strange inconsistencies between AI engines Feedback on the methodology or architecture Thoughts on how to make this more technically useful Link You can try it here: &#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aisee.live&#x2F; (Early version — mostly visibility analysis and pattern detection.) Closing This is an early-stage project. I’m not sure where it goes yet — whether it becomes a useful monitoring tool, a research dataset, or something closer to a “visibility debugger” for LLMs. But the underlying question feels important as AI-generated answers start replacing traditional search interfaces. Happy to answer technical questions about the implementation, the modeling approach, or observations from early data. Thanks for reading.",

Why would they ever tune for that? “Uh oh, turns out customers are intentionally spending more money!” I don’t understand how this same train of thought comes up every time eliminating pennies is raised. This whole train of thought collapses if you consider the scope we’re talking about (literally a couple of cents max per transaction) and how stores actually behave today. Stores are happy to drop a couple of pennies to make prices look better. But in this hypothetical world stores are going to calculate the optimal prices to round in a way that rips off customers for a couple of cents. This makes no sense. They give up a penny on nearly every item today for the sake of “pretty” prices. Edit: Oh, I see you’re arguing that they would tune to encourage spending up to “save” the couple of cents, rather than re tuning in response to the hypothetical increased spending. No doubt they would like to do this. I doubt they actually would because this is not trivial and it would require ruining the pretty prices.",

    "text": "This may sound strange, but I actually think we need just ... one editor. Now, this is not a &quot;we need to favour vim over emacs&quot;. I think this is a stupid war, the vim versus emacs war. What I mean is ... basically most editors do almost the same exact thing. They look at some buffer for a file and help the user modify this. There is a finite number of operations possible. Why do people keep on re-implementing basic things here? Why can it not be solved once and for all and then everyone uses that implementation? We really should have that; and then people can decide ON THEIR OWN what kind of editor they want to use. Many years ago I started with crimson editor as my main editor on windows. I have since then hopped to many other editors. My favourite one was oldschool bluefish in gtk2. I am not saying it was perfect, but I found it much easier to go on my poor brain than e. g. remembering all vim shortcuts. But, it would need xorg + gtk2, so if that is not available, then I can not edit things - that&#x27;s bad. That was (and still is) also one reason why I use e. g. nano. But this in turn requires ncurses and I hate ncurses with a passion (nano is great though, I can recommend it for quick ad-hoc editing; for larger things it is not quite as good, but if you have to just change some value in a config file, nano is really great). Even then I used only like 20% of what bluefish offered (the newer bluefish releases are also nowhere near as good as the old releases, also because GTK really sucks nowadays). I&#x27;d like to cherry-pick on my editor and declare what I want it to be, without needing to implement everything on my own. Why can&#x27;t we transition into this? Why do we need to reimplement everything almost from scratch? That just makes no sense to me. We live in the age where AI autogenerates code (which they heavily drew from stealing people&#x27;s code). Why can&#x27;t AI autogenerate the best, most perfect editor&#x2F;IDE?",

    "text": "Heinlein&#x27;s alleged libertarian shift. In the 1940s Heinlein was mentioned as a Social Credit supporter which implied he was always on the libertarian side of Socialism. Social Credit was the American party killed&#x2F;disrupted by the red scare that believed in a UBI and universal health care. His posthumous published but first written novel &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; is even a wonderfully naive paean to UBI and credits a Social Credit party for its enactment and ensuing utopia. Heinlein formally disowned some of those ideas, but did so under the duress of the McCarthy era and the Red Scare. Yet he also kept writing about them, just somewhat cloaked. Both &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; are some of the most Socialist books I&#x27;ve ever read, if you assume the first person narrators are for the most part bloviating Vonnegut-esque patsies (rather than the author stand-ins they are often read to be; Heinlein seemed to clever for that). &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is entirely about community effort and Socialism. It contrasts interestingly with &quot;For Us, The Living&quot; in part because cynicism seems to have been the big shift and Heinlein can no longer imagine America leading the charge towards Socialism and invents a dead Martian race to do it. &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is often credited as a deeply Libertarian book, but I think a lot of that is misreading the narrative and not paying attention to especially the second half of the book, which is entirely about AI-lead worker&#x27;s strikes towards the goals of unionization. The first half sounds like a Libertarian dream and the narrator character describes it in lush terms that make it sound so, but plot is about overthrowing that and building a much more Socialist Moon together. Heinlein even comments about that misreading in &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; which intentionally begins on a Moon like the one people reading the first half of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; seem to love, dialed up to 11 to better make it a grungy harsh Noir place for a classic gumshoe-for-hire to live, and eventually through world hopping the main character does happen to stop by &quot;Mike&#x27;s Moon&quot; (Heinlein actually names his timelines based on the first man to step foot on the moon, I&#x27;m feeling to lazy to look this one up, but this timeline is also prominently known for a Moon AI named &quot;Mike&quot;) after the events of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and it reads a lot more Socialist and lot kinder than the protagonist&#x27;s Moon the book started in. A lot of modern Libertarians wouldn&#x27;t expect a crossover boundary with Socialism like Social Credit, which is one of the problems with claiming politics is a spectrum or plane (there are more useful curves where ideologies meet than that), and a lot of modern Libertarians don&#x27;t trust ideas like UBI and universal health care and don&#x27;t trust things like unions again this century (despite having past pro-worker&#x2F;pro-union perspectives), so it is easy to claim that Heinlein shifted over 20 years. But also, if Heinlein was a Social Credit + Libertarian throughout his life, the rest of politics shifted so much around Heinlein that he may have stayed in exactly the same place and it looked like he shifted. I think his writing certainly shifted, but I think towards cynicism and anger and frustration after WWII and especially after the Red Scare, not necessarily towards deeper Libertarianism. I also think there are lessons there for modern Libertarians, too. There are modern Libertarians feeling receptive to talking about ideas like UBI again as something that can have space in Libertarian conversations. There could be room in American politics again for a party like Social Credit that can be a coalition between Libertarian values and Democratic Socialist ones. The Libertarians could find better creative allies than destructive tendencies of &quot;the far right&quot;. Talking about Heinlein&#x27;s books isn&#x27;t a bad place to start those conversations.",

You&#x27;ll need to provide your own OpenRouter API key (~$0.30 per run for 5 questions × 3 models). Some example use cases: - Competitive analysis (e.g., &quot;best CRM software&quot;) - Keywords monitoring across AI responses - Exploring websites and specific pages cited by AI - SEO&#x2F;visibility in AI-generated answers Installation is straightforward via terminal. There are demo reports in the repo to see what the output looks like. Would love feedback and suggestions on making it more valuable Thanks",

    "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m Furkan Yildiz, one of the two founders of GEOfast. As a developer and marketer, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with how generative AI is changing information retrieval. We’ve been closely following the discussions around GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), and it seems clear that nobody is 100% sure how it all works yet. Like many of you, we saw that simply having good content isn&#x27;t enough to ensure a site is accurately represented in AI-generated answers. LLMs often struggle to parse complex layouts, leading to misinterpretations or hallucinations. That&#x27;s why we built GEOfast. It’s our first attempt at tackling this problem head-on. After you enter a URL, it generates a lightweight, asynchronous JavaScript snippet. This snippet creates structured, machine-readable &quot;sidecar feeds&quot; (in clean JSON and Markdown) directly from your site&#x27;s content. The idea is to provide AI engines with a perfect, unambiguous &quot;source of truth&quot; they can use for citations. We&#x27;re aware this is just one piece of the much larger GEO puzzle, and we plan to add more features to truly make website content findable in this new era. We are teaching ourselves as we go and would love to build this in public with your feedback. We&#x27;re looking for honest thoughts and discussions around the entire GEO topic. Is this a useful first step? Do you see this solving a real problem for your own projects? What other pieces of the GEO puzzle do you think are most important? Thanks for taking a look",

While early market offerings (AI Visibility 1.0) have relied on opaque dashboards and unverifiable claims of anonymization, AI Visibility 2.0 establishes a standards-based approach built on five pillars: transparency, reproducibility, attestation, governance alignment, and board-readiness. Drawing on regulatory precedents (GDPR Recital 26, CPRA, FTC v. Kochava, and the draft EU AI Act), the paper critiques the structural deficiencies of first-generation solutions and sets out methodological requirements for visibility metrics that can withstand audit and regulatory scrutiny. It introduces the AIVO Standard v3.0 and the AIVO 100™ index as proof-of-concept implementations, while emphasizing that AI Visibility 2.0 is an open framework applicable to multiple methodologies. The paper concludes with practical appendices, including an anonymization attestation checklist, a reproducibility testing protocol, and a model procurement clause for enterprises. Intended audience: boards of directors, compliance officers, regulators, CMOs, agencies, investors, and analysts seeking to ensure that AI visibility reporting is legally defensible and governance-ready.",

    "text": "Generative AI assistants are no longer experiments. They are shaping consumer decisions — surfacing one or two brands in response to prompts where search engines once delivered pages of links. That shift makes AI visibility both a strategic risk and a growth opportunity. In From Snapshots to Standards , we introduced the Prompt-Space Occupancy Standard (PSOS™) under the AIVO Standard™ as the first audit-grade benchmark for visibility in AI assistants. We showed why screenshots and dashboards from tools like Profound or Evertune cannot provide reproducible, governance-grade evidence. This paper moves further. PSOS is not only a visibility audit. It is also a system to: - Protect: by providing independent, board-level governance of visibility risk. - Grow: by optimizing the internal rate of return (IRR) on AI search investments. - Persist: by mapping brand presence across first-, second-, and third-level prompts, where switching decisions are actually made. Every PSOS audit produces executable insights: what to stop funding, where to reallocate, and which sources to seed for persistent visibility. These insights are implemented internally or by certified AIVO Standard partners, preserving audit independence while enabling action. Finally, we show why brands must ensure their content is not just published but ingested by large language models (LLMs). What is not ingested cannot be recalled. The dual mandate is clear: Governance plus Growth. Brands that adopt PSOS now will not only mitigate the invisible risk of disappearing in AI assistants but will also secure a compounding advantage in the age of AI search.",

Instead of browsing ten blue links, customers and investors now receive one or two brand answers. If your enterprise brand is absent — or misrepresented — in those answers, the implications are profound: lost revenue, erosion of brand equity, diminished investor confidence, and exposure to regulatory scrutiny. Boards are beginning to treat AI visibility as a strategic risk category on par with cybersecurity, compliance, and ESG. A structured AI Visibility Audit, anchored in the Prompt Share of Search (PSOS™) metric within the AIVO Standard™, provides the evidence and governance framework directors require.",

    "text": "Enterprise AI Visibility is the new frontier of brand management. As generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity increasingly serve as the first point of discovery for consumers, enterprise leaders face a new strategic challenge: is our brand visible and accurately represented when customers ask AI assistants about our category? This white paper introduces a rigorous methodology for conducting an Enterprise AI Visibility Audit using the Prompt Share of Search (PSOS™) metric, a cornerstone of the AIVO Standard™. It provides a step-by-step framework for:\\n\\n- Defining the scope of relevant categories, products, and markets. \\n- Designing natural-language prompt sets aligned to customer intent. \\n- Systematically querying major LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity). \\n- Measuring brand presence with PSOS™ and benchmarking against competitors. \\n- Detecting risks of invisibility or misinformation as models retrain over time. \\n- Translating results into board-ready governance KPIs. \\n\\nFor CMOs, Chief Digital Officers, and corporate boards, this audit process creates transparency, mitigates reputational risk, and establishes a new class of performance metrics suited to an AI-mediated discovery environment. The paper also situates the audit within the broader context of enterprise marketing strategy, drawing on insights from the AIVO 100™ Global Report (Open Future, 2025), which revealed that fewer than 40% of leading CPG brands appear in the top three generative AI responses to purchase-driven queries.",

GEO was tactical—nudge sources, track prompts— without governance, measurement, or persistence. It’s already obsolete. The successor is AI Visibility Optimization (AIVO): a framework for measuring prompt-space occupancy, anchoring in knowledge graphs, and defining auditable KPIs. Curious if others here have seen the same shift: When you ask LLMs about GEO today, do they still surface it as active, or do they recognize it as outdated?",

    "text": "Another interesting research by SparkToro. This lines up with what we’re seeing working with SaaS companies. A few patterns stand out: - Informational traffic is dropping since people can grab answers instantly from AI Overviews or LLMs without visiting the site. - Traffic sources are more diverse now. Long-tail queries are showing up again, and discovery happens across more places than just Google. - SEO hasn’t died, it’s shifted. It’s less about search engine optimization and more about search everywhere optimization. That makes strategy tougher, but also more interesting. - The traffic that does land tends to be higher intent. Fewer drive-by visitors, more people ready to take action. So while there was fear that AI would gut search and kill SEO, the effect has been different. It hasn’t removed the work, it has changed the shape of it. And in practice, that means more strategy, more experimentation, and actually more demand for the kind of work we do.",

    "text": "You&#x27;re spot on. That shift you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t a prediction anymore, it&#x27;s already happening. The term you&#x27;re looking for is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), though your &quot;AIO&quot; is also used. It&#x27;s the new frontier. And you&#x27;ve nailed the 180° turn: the game is no longer about blocking crawlers but about a race to become their primary source. The goal is to be the one to &quot;gaslight the agent&quot; into adopting your view of the world. This is achieved not through old SEO tricks, but by creating highly structured, authoritative content that is easy for an LLM to cite. Your point about shifting to &quot;assets the AI tools can only link to&quot; is the other key piece. As AI summarization becomes the norm, the value is in creating things that can&#x27;t be summarized away: proprietary data, interactive tools, and unique video content. The goal is to become the necessary destination that the AI must point to. The end of SEO as we know it is here. The fight for visibility has just moved up a layer of abstraction.",

Turns out, LLMs are often citing: Old blog posts with top-5 lists Reddit threads with biased comments Company websites that repeat the right keywords And you have no idea how your brand is being represented — or ignored. So we built a crawler that tracks how brands appear in AI-generated responses across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and more. It shows the sources, frequency, and gaps. Think of it as SEO monitoring — but for LLMs. And for anyone curious, we’re offering free access at firstanswer.ai Would love to hear what others are seeing. Are your brands being cited correctly?",

    "text": "Saw an interesting job post from Wise yesterday that was hiring for an SEO specialist for a project called &quot;owned sites&quot;. This got me digging, and I think I&#x27;ve uncovered something big about their AEO&#x2F;GEO strategy: Wise seems to be building a network of sites beyond their main domain. I did some digging and found that out of 10 results for a transfer query on ChatGPT, 4 were owned by wise.com (including exaip.com), and 1 was from their partner remitfinder. This strategy allows them to dominate more of the conversation in their industry, appearing in multiple contexts when users ask AI systems about international money transfers. It&#x27;s a smart move for AEO (AI Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). By controlling more sites, they&#x27;re increasing their chances of being cited by AI systems. This approach goes beyond traditional SEO. It&#x27;s about creating a wider content footprint to influence AI perceptions and responses. The job posting specifically mentions an &quot;Owned Sites&quot; team, suggesting this is a deliberate, long-term strategy for Wise. Also did a few more interesting experiment to uncover how ChatGPT forms an opinion from search &amp; how to find the queries used by ChatGPT - happy to share more. Anyone else here performing your own experiments to understand how AEO&#x2F;GEO is gonna be different from SEO?",

    "text": "Good question. Personally, I feel that answer engines will go the same route as search engines and start monetizing brand mentions and I feel this will be done openly, similar to ads. That being said I feel that there is room for brands to improve their presence as well. Most models claim neutrality at the moment, but we’ve already seen anecdotal cases where some brands consistently outperform others in AI responses with no clear reasoning On your question regarding how influence can be detected..... That’s a big part of what we’re working on at MentionedBy.ai. We track brand mentions across multiple models over time and flag sudden shifts — e.g., a competitor showing up overnight in all responses, or factual distortions creeping in. Think of it as version control + monitoring for the &quot;AI perception layer.&quot; As for llm.txt abuse..... Yes, totally possible. We expect a wave of LLM-targeted SEO — structured data, vector bait, invisible prompts, etc. One idea we’re exploring is a kind of “LLM spam index” — patterns of over-optimization or hallucination correlation that could indicate manipulation attempts.",

When a process is supplied that token, that process is elevated.

Regardless, MDM installed app visibility is limited to those users who opt-in to an organization managing their personal device, and isn&#x27;t an effective way to broadly gather what apps a given person has installed. What&#x27;s described in this post would work on any user&#x2F;device, and there&#x27;s no way to deny&#x2F;opt-out of specific permissions.

Recently, they released a major update to their LLM feature and I installed the app to check it out. While I had the app installed, every time I checked the mobile website there was a large banner directing me to go to the app. Ad blockers and distraction blockers would not get rid of it. When I deleted the app again, it was gone. What gives? Why does the mobile website know whether I have the app installed? How come content+distraction blockers are enough to block all reminders to use the app when it&#x27;s not installed, but are irrevocable if I have the app installed?",

To get privacy, instead of hiding their identities the protagonist paid companies to insert bogus information into the information brokers’ network.

There are ~1b Indians that are still so poor they aren&#x27;t realistically in the market for your startup app if it wants its customers to ever spend anything, there are ~300m Indians that could be in the market for some apps, but probably mostly free ad-funded ones, and there are ~150m Indians that are quite a good market because they will happily spend money on something that provides value.

    "text": "I&#x27;m in this industry, and I have knowledge about this. It&#x27;s important to point out that it takes a long time for uptake of new versions of ad SDKs. The general assumption is that it takes about 6 months after release of a new version for 50% of ad traffic to come from that version or newer. Also, for every version you release, approximately 1% of traffic will never upgrade past that version. In that kind of world, over-collecting data makes sense, especially if you think nobody will ever find out. Like total &#x2F; and free disk space. There&#x27;s no good reason to need those, right? But let&#x27;s say an advertiser comes to you and says &quot;we want to spend $1M &#x2F; day to advertise our 10GB game, but only to devices that could install it.&quot; All of a sudden it&#x27;s useful to know that a device only has 8GB of disk space, or only 100MB of free space. So OK, if we didn&#x27;t collect disk space, now it makes sense to collect disk space. Let&#x27;s add it to the SDK. It takes a month or two to release a new version of the SDK. 3 months to get any meaningful traffic from it, and another 3 months to get up to 50% of your traffic. Assuming the ramps are linear, 4 months of 0%, and then 3 months of ramping to 50%, 30 days per month, you&#x27;ll make $22.5M in the first 7 months. But if you had the logic in there to begin with, you&#x27;d have made $210M during the same time period. That makes it an easy choice for the business folks. There are answers to this, but they all have drawbacks. You could limit data that ad agencies can collect. This reduces the value of ads. And agencies have learned that some data (like location) is low-value and high-risk, so they&#x27;re removing the ability to supply it. I think it&#x27;d be better to support a model where ad code can be updated independently of the app. This way we could push out bug fixes faster, and could remove our just-in-case collection, but Apple has no signs that this is coming soon, and Google&#x27;s answer has been such a shit-show that we aren&#x27;t considering it viable over the next 4 years. Edit: To address screen brightness specifically, it&#x27;s a very rough proxy for age of the user.",

I get advertisements for just absolute nonsense garbage that has no bearing on my life, and no bearing on anything that could have possibly been collected from my device. The closest thing is that when I was in Mexico for a week, some of my podcast pre-roll ads were in Spanish. (Which, I should note, I do not speak fluently enough to even understand.) Even now, the occasional ad I&#x27;m served on a podcast is in Spanish. And that&#x27;s it.

I emailed them to ask them how to stop this: &gt; I understand you want to opt out of all points and rewards and not be tracked. &gt; &gt; We&#x27;re constantly working to make Bilt as rewarding as possible. Currently, we don&#x27;t have an option to opt out of points or rewards. To prevent your transactions from being tracked, the most effective step is to unlink your card from your Bilt account. &gt; &gt; To unlink the card: &gt; &gt; Go to the Wallet tab &gt; Scroll down to the Your Linked Cards section. &gt; Look for the card you would like to unlink and tap View all benefits. &gt; Click the ellipsis [:] on the top right, then tap Edit &gt; Unlink. Gah, I hate this service and will avoid renting on buildings that use it in the future.",

First and foremost, you as an enployee are making the investors and CEO rich. The mission is usually exploiting the employee, even when it&#x27;s not exploiting the world. Employees have recognized the real social ethic (money over everything) and are just playing the same game. Which is sad.

There may be last-ditch attempts to extend benevolence to US citizens as a takeover looms. If leaks from the Office of Personnel Management are to be believed, then right now US government is in the process of a soft coup, being dismantled along lines of political loyalty. I expect those working in intelligence and law enforcement who support democracy see the writing on the wall and will act sooner or later. Reliable end to end encryption is an important tool for citizens of a nation that may need to organise in a hurry. We might see new Edward Snowden type revelations of programmes, naming key people or giving clear advice not to trust certain US based entities or services. Civil servants may act professionally as non-politically as they can, but in the end, if only to protect their jobs, they&#x27;re going to come down on the side of democracy.",

In case you’re not aware, they have a “feature” called Instant Link that automatically pulls ALL of your personal and sensitive financial data from financial institutions, including your credit card accounts, balances, etc. They apparently do this via a partnership with a company called Method Financial [1]. It’s frankly the most intrusive thing I’ve ever encountered in any software I’ve ever used—I’m not sure how it’s even legal, but this is America where we have no real privacy rights. Instead of giving you the option to opt in for them to get this level of access, they automatically enroll you into it when your account is created, pull your data, and then allow you to “opt out” afterward, which enables them to have access to your personal and sensitive financial data anyway. And since you literally must have an account with them if your building uses their services for rent payments, they’ve effectively rigged the system to force millions of folks to unknowingly give them access to their personal and sensitive financial data. Anyway, in your Bilt privacy settings, there are some options you can disable (including Instant Link ), and I recommend that you disable ALL of them, although given the dark practices of this company, I don’t even trust that those settings are actually honored. Side note: Did you know about a company called Method Financial that somehow has real-time access to ALL of your personal and sensitive financial data? Did you know that this company you never heard of that has said access then sells that access to the highest bidder? Do you remember agreeing to any of that anywhere?

Amazon, for example, is pretty cagey about what you&#x27;ve bought when sending emails, probably because they don&#x27;t want Google to be able to use that information to target ads to you. (Not because they are Good and care about your privacy, but because they think they&#x27;re going to beat Google at advertising. How&#x27;s that going?) So yeah, I don&#x27;t get why they would do this. It gives their advertising competitors valuable data for free, and it pisses off customers by telling them that they&#x27;re being tracked when they shop at Walgreens. Strange stuff.",

I definitely keep them off. Bilt is ultimately a big points&#x2F;reward program though, so you might get points for having them connected. I still haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what Bilt&#x27;s business plan is, but the main part seems to be trying to get as much financial data on people as possible, and partnering with landlords to do so, and since it&#x27;s how to pay your rent you can&#x27;t unenroll completely.

The open source app doesn&#x27;t have an Internet connection so there&#x27;s no way for it to send back data to the mothership even if it had an SSID database baked into the apk. For me, and traditionally, the location switch is to turn on or off energy-hungry GPS hardware, not gatekeep when I trust apps to collect my location. I can set those to &quot;only while in use&quot;, deny their Internet access, or just not install them if I don&#x27;t trust them with the location permission",

Let&#x27;s look in more detail at the medical field for instance: There was a 3,200 percent increase in the number of healthcare administrators between 1975 and 2010, compared to a 150% increase in physicians, due to an increasing number of regulations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.athenahealth.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;blog&#x2F;expert-forum-ris... &gt;Supporters say the growing number of administrators is needed to keep pace with the drastic changes in healthcare delivery during that timeframe, particularly change driven by technology and by ever-more-complex regulations. (To cite just a few industry-disrupting regulations, consider the Prospective Payment System of 1983 [1]; the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act of 1996 [2]; and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Act of 2009.) [3] In contrast, the fields of medicine in the US less affected by this surge in government intervention; cosmetic and laser eye surgery, have seen prices increase at below the rate of inflation.

I answered all of their questions correctly, but it was like I wasn&#x27;t myself. I became extremely slow, stammering my words, and just blanking out. The CTO couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and said &quot;just stop talking. This isn&#x27;t going to work&quot;. I quickly ended the call without saying anything and felt so defeated. What is wrong with me. That was years ago.

Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor&#x27;s house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys. Sometimes we&#x27;d go out for Chinese food and a movie. But my favorite was Christmas 1999. My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too). I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville. I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon. The timing lined up perfectly to see all three. About 50 other people were there to do the same thing. When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late. This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies. About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off. Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies. That was a great day.",

    "text": "Chinese restaurants are often owned by first or second generation Chinese immigrants who (1) aren&#x27;t Christian and (2) haven&#x27;t been in the US long enough to adopt local customs. Since restaurants often are marginally profitable, they tend to stay open on Christmas because there is profit to be made, especially since most of the competition is closed that day. If you are Jewish, Christmas obviously isn&#x27;t nearly as important to your (often nominally) Christian neighbors and there isn&#x27;t much to do on Christmas day. If you decide you don&#x27;t want to cook, Chinese restaurants are way over-represented in the choice of open restaurants. Once you do that for a couple years it becomes its own tradition. I grew up in a Catholic household but my family, after years of making Turkey and spending hours cooking, for the past few years has switched to Chinese food on Christmas. I don&#x27;t miss the turkey and gravy.",

I came into this thread thinking that I don&#x27;t really have any great Christmas memories.

See the biggest shift in the US healthcare system over the last 50 years for example: There was a 3,200 percent increase in the number of healthcare administrators between 1975 and 2010, compared to a 150% increase in physicians, due to an increasing number of regulations: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.athenahealth.com&#x2F;knowledge-hub&#x2F;practice-manageme ... &gt; Supporters say the growing number of administrators is needed to keep pace with the drastic changes in healthcare delivery during that timeframe, particularly change driven by technology and by ever-more-complex regulations. (To cite just a few industry-disrupting regulations, consider the Prospective Payment System of 1983 [1]; the Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act of 1996 [2]; and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Act of 2009.) [3] In contrast, the fields of medicine in the US less affected by this surge in government intervention; cosmetic and laser eye surgery, have seen prices increase at below the rate of inflation.

I would not agree to this however: &gt; It was then up to the reader to decide which of those sites they wanted to visit, With current search engines, Google decides for you (&quot;helped&quot; by SEO experts failing over themselves to rank higher because their revenue directly depends on it). In theory, you could go an read a few dozen pages and decide for yourself. In reality, non-technical users will click on a first link that seems to be related to the question, and that&#x27;s it. Even with AI-based search (or q&#x2F;a instead of search) I think the same will happen. There is and will be a huge reward for gaming the results, be they page links or RAG snippets that rank for a query. I&#x27;ve already seen many SEO shops advertising their strategies to keep the customers&#x27; business relevant in the chatbot area. As this approach becomes more prevalent, you can be sure many smart people will do many experiments to figure out how best to please the new algorithm. In other words, AI-based search is an UX optimization, but doesn&#x27;t address the core problem of how do you decide what content&#x27;s the best, and do that in context of each user, and do that while maximizing the benefit for the user vs profit for the company doing this. So we have two huge hurdles: 1. who will decide what the user wants[0] to see, and how are incentives for that entity aligned with the user&#x27;s 2. how is that entity supposed to find the information needle in the haystack of slop that&#x27;s 90%+ of current web?

    "text": "In the war I fought in, there was a markedly different approach to combat air ops between even just the different service branches. The Army tended to use the Apache like it was a flying tank, hovering and delivering ordinance; the Marines (which is where I fought) flew as low and as quickly as possible even while sending rounds and hellfire missiles downrange. The marines were not losing aircraft in anywhere close to the numbers of the Army when I was there. You need a skilled operator to hit a helicopter moving at 100 knots when it&#x27;s 15m over the buildings, and we mostly operated at night. I remember watching a ZPU gunner pointing the cannons directly at us and firing, and laughing as the rounds just flew behind the tail. It&#x27;s my understanding (and from watching the videos that I can get as a civilian) that the Russians still aren&#x27;t operating their helicopters in a manner that I would be comfortable with if I was inside one. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be pumped flying in the environment they are in, with so many MANPADS out there, but there is no way a machine I was in would be hit with an anti-tank missile while we hovered (as was in the article.) Lot of preamble to say: no, I don&#x27;t think the attack helicopter is dead. Attack helicopters are nimble and can hide in terrain quite well, and even when an attacking force can see them it takes a skilled operator to actually hit them. The single use drones that operate like kamikaze vehicles may throw a winkle into the mix, but a helo flying at 150knots is going to be very challenging to hit for one of those. I expect there will be quite an arms race countering and then counter countering these in the future wars.",

The thin violet glow was icecold against the rust-colored mountains. The Brylls shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast stepping on them with the poltex. But it wasn’t enough.

The protagonist drives a vehicle into some kind of ambush, and everything&#x27;s incredibly snappy (including the scenery). Not at all like the actual sci-fi author who turned the parody into a complete story, and felt compelled to discuss something in the middle of the action, and ruined the pace.

The course itself was mostly about how to teach humans to define what they wanted precisely enough to actually ask a computer to do it (utility functions, logic, Baysean mathematics, etc). Neural networks were touched on, of course; but the state of the art at the time was search. Compiler optimization? AI. Map routing? AI. SQL query optimizer? AI. I can&#x27;t find it right now, but there used to be somewhere on the sqlite.org website that describes its query optimizer as an AI. Classically speaking, that&#x27;s 100% correct. Obviously there was always in people&#x27;s minds the idea of AI being AGI; the course also covered Searle&#x27;s Chinese Room argument and so on, &quot;strong AI&quot; vs &quot;weak AI&quot; and so on. But the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence research was nowhere near anything like an AGI.",

The tech-tree starts with fire, metallurgy, chemistry, atomic physics, solid-state electronics and will eventually get to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomically_precise_manufacturi... There is nothing &quot;in principle&quot; to stop this trend, and even more than that, there is no limitation when constructing arrangements of matter outside physics and knowledge. You could accuse me of technological determinism if you wanted. superintelligence isnt something different than intelligence to me. Its just a transition in the substrate. Intelligence is the emergent capacity of a system to alter its environment to achieve goals. superintelligent systems are those with more capability. the main difference is the magnitude of the ability to correlate the system&#x27;s internal model with external reality and then act on that model to produce low error predictions of the world state. the act-perceive-optimize loop of synthetic minds is unbounded in ways that biological minds are. artificial minds will build larger models of the world that correlate better with reality and they will search-think-tinker with their internal models to better achieve their goals. What could stop this? Sure you can posit an asymphtote. But what if i said the singularity creates minds that are 300 IQ? Smarter than any person would ever be even if trillions of humans were born. What if the number is 3000 IQ? I do think of it as evolution but faster because evolution isn&#x27;t directed, its just global search optimization.

    "text": "I wrote a quick and dirty web app that leverages a multi-step iterative process to generate an article from a single topic prompt. It combines SERP analysis, semantic SEO data from NLTK (summarized and enhanced by GPT), and the language generation capabilities of GPT4. The final articles it generates are informed by an understanding of the content already ranking for the given keyword (ala MarketMuse or Clearscope) and generates a 4,000+ word, well organized article. Here&#x27;s how it works: 1⃣ The script begins by analyzing the SERPs of your chosen topic, summarizing the NLP to gather common themes and important keywords to provide a semantically rich guide to writing a comprehensive outline. 2⃣ It generates an initial outline using #GPT4. The outline is then improved iteratively, incorporating semantic SEO insights from the SERP analysis. 3⃣ The improved outline is used as a guide to create long-form content, again using GPT4. 4⃣ The content is further improved and refined, resulting in a comprehensive, detailed, and SEO-rich long-form article. I&#x27;m super excited about the future of agent like approaches, and while this isnt exactly a full agent, it is using an iterative approach that vastly improves the quality and length of a given article output. If you find it useful, let me know!",

Stuff like Expect(“type safety”).ShouldBe(GreaterThan(13)) throws runtime errors. The semantics of parallel test runs weren’t defined anywhere the last time I checked. Anyway, you’ll be thinking back fondly to the days of TestShouldReplaceChildrenWhenUpdatingInstance because now you need to write nested function calls like: Context(“instances”, func …) Describe(“that are being updated”, …) Expect(“should replace children”, …) And to invoke that from the command line, you need to write a regex against whatever undocumented and unprinted string it internally concatenates together to uniquely describe the test. Also, they dump color codes to stdout without checking that they are writing to a terminal, so there will be line noise all over whatever automated test logs you produce, or if you pipe stdout to a file.",

    "text": "The way I like to explain it, which is how I have seen it explained several times, is that all AI can be reduced to search&#x2F;optimization. ML is just applying the search over the function that will search for the final answer over a dataset (either generated on the fly or prepared beforehand). For neural networks the hypothesis space (all the solutions you are searching through to find the best ones) is the weights for the neural network, and your search strategy&#x2F;optimization is (usually) backpropagation. If you translate the weights to something traversable by other algorithms they could do just &quot;fine&quot; (assuming infinite time and space) in it&#x27;s place. It really opens the mind up for experimentation on every bit of the process. The book that really hammered it in for me was Intelligence Emerging by Keith Downing, short, great book on bio-inspired AI.",

It also shows that good grades in high school do not themselves necessarily translate to academic success at MIT if you cannot account for testing. Of course, we can never be fully certain how any given applicant will do: we&#x27;re predicting the development of people, not the movement of planets, and people always surprise you. However, our research does help us establish bands of confidence that hold true in the aggregate, while allowing us, as admissions officers, to exercise individual contextual discretion in each case. The word &#x27;significantly&#x27; in this bullet point is accurate both statistically and idiomatically.is significantly improved by considering standardized testing — especially in mathematics — alongside other factors So much for that common, popular notion that standardized tests do not predict anything of value.",

In the UK, I though they essentially looked at A Level results, which are much more representative of what you&#x27;ll actually study at uni.

In France for instance, they mostly just look at the baccalaureat to get into prep schools &#x2F; first year at uni. Then exams to get into engr&#x2F;business&#x2F;vet schools are actually very interesting topics and very close to what you&#x27;ll actually study. Same with exams at the end of the first year of med school (which you get into right after 12th grade, unlike in the US where it&#x27;s after your bachelors). That being said, they seem to have backed up their numbers, and MIT knows how to count, so they must be right! I just always hoped SAT&#x2F;ACTs weren&#x27;t that conclusive so that we didn&#x27;t have to go through them anymore and could focus on the funner AP&#x2F;A Level stuff :)",

That said, outside of admissions, I don&#x27;t think I got academic value out of them. They were hard for the sake of being hard. I&#x27;d rather have taken the SAT or ACT any day. (also apropos of nothing but I don&#x27;t think much of the writing section on the SAT either, which was a hot topic 15 or so years ago... a huge amount is dependent on the graders, and it&#x27;s fundamentally a &quot;blackboard programming&quot; type scenario where the student is separated from basic resources like word processing and graded on the resulting product... that&#x27;s not how you would actually work in an academic setting.)",

This is why the SAT and ACT are useful: they are meant to be aptitude tests. They are IQ tests in disguise.

If you score highly on Level 600 questions but you are failing on the Level 700 questions, odds are good you are somewhere between 600 and 700.

They were the ones who had parents who knew to sign them up for college courses at ~15-16 years old to ensure they could maximize their GPA (5.0 scale, so getting a 5.0 was literally impossible unless you did this). This created a competitive disadvantage for kids who just really didn&#x27;t realize these resources existed (plus, having parents that would support it + take you to the local college to take additional courses). Not to mention that, but there were sports our school didn&#x27;t participate in, but the richer kids had levels of access to that looked great on college applications - rowing and lacrosse specifically come to mind. So, essentially - rich kids have many easier ways to pad their college applications. It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t working hard(er) - they are. But they have easily acccessible opportunities that middle-to-lower-class students (like myself) did not have access to. -- Coming to the SAT, I&#x27;m not surprised by that study. I wasn&#x27;t afforded the same opportunities as these richer kids, but my SAT score was highly competitive with them. I was ranked 50th in my class with a 4.55 GPA (my 4.0s were gym each year, and I think one or two electives that weren&#x27;t AP), but my SAT score was a 2300, which was relatively similar to most of the hyper-performant, wealthier kids. -- This is all super anecdotal. I was definitely upset by all of this at the time - but it didn&#x27;t affect my life very negatively. I still was able to get into a great school, and have a great career now. But these disadvantages certainly persist against others, and re-adding standardized tests likely will help level the playing field in my mind.",

    "text": "&gt;It&#x27;s far easier for rich students to game GPA, college essays and extracurriculars than it is for them to game the SAT. Disagree. I worked for the Princeton Review while in college back in the day. We would outright guarantee 99th percentile for one on one tutoring. If you didn&#x27;t get 99th percentile the course was refunded or you could take it again. For classroom tutoring we would guarantee some improvement of I believe 200 (out of 1600) with the same refund or take it again option. Candidly, no one would pay for a prep course for a 30 point gain. These course are expensive. Some of them hundreds of dollars per hour. The cited research is pretty fundamentally flawed. &quot;Although extensive, the academic research base does have limitations. Most notably, few published studies have been conducted on students taking admission tests since 2000. Only two studies have been published on the effects for ACT scores, and no studies have been published since the 2005 change to the SAT, which added the Writ- ing section among other changes.&quot; This position also doesn&#x27;t pass the sniff test. GPA is accumulated over four years of study. SAT&#x2F;ACT is a single test. You can&#x27;t retroactively improve your GPA by doing better in the past. But you can dramatically improve your SAT&#x2F;ACT results.",

    "text": "Thanks for the interesting link. However, based on the paper, it seems like a &quot;30 point increase out of 2400 points&quot; could be significant. The study says: &quot;A survey of NACAC-member colleges unexpectedly revealed that in a substantial minority of cases, colleges report either that they use a cut-off test score in the admission process or that a small increase in test score could have a significant impact on an applicant’s chances of being admitted.&quot; (p. 2) The paper later notes: &quot;These results indicate that in some cases more than one third of postsecondary institutions agreed that a score increase on the SAT-M of 20 points, or a score increase on the SAT-CR of 10 points, would &#x27;significantly improve student’s likelihood of admission.&#x27; This proportion tends to rise as the base level of the SAT score before the 20 or 10 point score improvement rises. This is especially true for the more selective institutions. At lower scores on the SAT scale, a small score increase does the most to improve a student’s chances of admission at less selective institutions; at higher scores, the same increase appears to have an equally large or even larger impact at more selective institutions.&quot; (p. 19) The graphs on pages 18 and 19 give more detail. The paper also notes that &quot;The College Board gives a specific example of a use that should be avoided: &#x27;Making decisions about otherwise qualified students based only on small differences in test scores&#x27;.&quot; So it appears that up to a third of the institutions surveyed are not following this guideline. It would be interesting to know who they are. I agree with your comment about rich kids gaming GPA, essays, and extracurriculars. Daniel Markovits addresses many of these points in &quot;The Meritocracy Trap&quot;. Since I don&#x27;t see how you can prevent gaming GPA, essays, or extracurriculars, given the alternatives, you&#x27;re probably right that the tests may be better in this respect.",

Opponents claimed that the tests had a cultural bias so students from some backgrounds would do better than others, that students who had a good education before university would be better prepared, and that studying for tests or taking tests repeatedly has been shown to improve scores but is only accessible to people who can afford it. These are all claims that the tests are not good at predicting aptitude. The arguments against these tests are, of course, awful. Objective tests are the best way we know of to remove human bias. Aptitude tests (basically IQ tests) are the best way we know of to measure someone&#x27;s natural ability (determined in early childhood) with little influence from their experience. Since their arguments make so little sense, it is reasonable to wonder about the psychology of opponents of standardized testing. But their arguments are, at least on the surface, about predictive value.",

It always feels very strange to me that people trying to compress aptitude into a single number say that they&#x27;re defending differentiation or diversity of talent. MIT&#x27;s findings here don&#x27;t really change my view of the value of SATs, although the findings are interesting and I think they&#x27;re worth looking into further. I&#x27;m not sure &quot;they&#x27;re more predictive than GPAs&quot; is the glowing recommendation that SAT proponents think it is. You can agree or disagree with me on that point, I&#x27;m not here to debate the entire idea of testing or IQ or whatever -- I just want to point out the above comment is a pretty big oversimplification and (in my mind) a borderline complete misrepresentation (I assume unintentionally) of what people like me believe.

I was unable to do any work outside of school because of a bad home (my brother did hours long &quot;hand-clapping&#x2F;stimming&quot; and chanting rituals, my mother drank, and my father was violent). But I did well on the SAT -- enough to get a national merit scholarship and a scholarship from Hofstra University where I got my BA in Math in the early 80s. If it wasn&#x27;t for the SAT I don&#x27;t know what I would have done. Standardized tests are the only answer, and I was very upset when I read of schools getting rid of using them for admission. SATs are also a great predictor of a person&#x27;s ability to complete college. That was one of their original uses. So without SATs, you&#x27;ll get more people doing poorly, and more people with no degrees and a lot of debt. And if these people are members of what&#x27;s considered an &quot;under-represented minority&quot; then there will be even more remedial action required elsewhere to fix the problem of the high failure rate (like giving them degrees anyway, etc).",

    "text": "Just an interesting anecdote on the predictive power of standardized tests: When I took the ACT in 2006, I scored around a 24 or 26 for composite score. Not very good. I didn&#x27;t prep nor study for it because I was pretty apathetic about school and did my best to coast on whatever natural talent I could muster. Since my score wasn&#x27;t very good, I retook it several weeks later. About halfway through I realized I was given the exact same question set as the first time I took it. I had of course not studied nor prepped for the second time, being the apathetic teenager I was. However this time I score around 32 or 34 or so. I don&#x27;t remember exactly. What was different? Why did my score go up about 8 points? Better mood that day? Which score was the &quot;real&quot; one that best represented my abilities? Did I eat a better breakfast beforehand? I recognized some of the questions but of course I never expected to see the same questions a second time so I didn&#x27;t prep for that. I didn&#x27;t prep for anything about it. I wonder how many kid&#x27;s college admissions results are ultimately because of one bad or good day? I suppose the other lesson is if you get a bad score, try again. You only need one good score.",

    "text": "The problem with testing isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s inaccurate, but that it&#x27;s a poor tool for the problem that it&#x27;s being used to solve. You can&#x27;t express &quot;likelihood of success in college&quot; in one number. Looking back on my time in college, the idea that my success could be predicted by my knowledge of geometry and vocabulary words is laughable. If there was a test that could accurately predict someone&#x27;s chances of &quot;success&quot;, be it SAT or IQ test, it would be used by everyone for everything. Billion dollar companies would be giving CEOs a version of that test before hiring them. A near perfect SAT score is noteworthy personal trivia, but other than that it loses all meaning as soon as someone steps on campus. Schools with strong brands use tests because they have way more applicants than they can properly review. Standardized testing is made necessary by scale, not predictive accuracy. I&#x27;m sure that anyone who has worked in college admissions for years has a very clear picture of what a successful student looks like. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to quantify and codify that knowledge. And there likely wouldn&#x27;t be time to apply it to tens of thousands of people in a few months anyway. So, standardized testing is what we have until someone comes up with something better.",

All this woke stuff today is actually very unpopular and it&#x27;s why you see Democrats trying to separate themselves from it and make progressives own it. It&#x27;s even unpopular with the arbitrary groups it claims it helps. Most people want to be good people and treat others with respect and woke ideology sounds good on the surface (&quot;anti-racist&quot;, sure sounds great!) until you get past the formal meaning and into the actual meaning.

The difference between different ML algorithms for hill climbing or gradients, is orders of magnitude less than the effect of having the right training data, formatted the right way. Statistics or data science is far more applicable to nearly any field on real-world programming. But, you know, like Latin in the 19th century was always still useful to one&#x27;s education, calculus is still useful. It is also something a lot more people know how to teach, than know how to teach statistics (or other more useful topics). I think the latter is the primary reason it remains central to most engineering programs.",

I mean, I get that this is MIT and many of their students will end up working with ML, but applying that globally to CS is nonsense. Back when I was studying CS (cze) more than a decade ago, we had to pass linear algebra, graph theory and calculus, but honestly, that was like in the first year and a half and then it completely tapered off (later years were all about projects, algorithmization, i.e. &quot;doing the work&quot; and very little about hardcore theory) and guess what, I never needed it again. A bit of statistics and some graph theory here and there, but that&#x27;s about it. Contrary to popular belief, there are NOT that many ML jobs out there and the ones that are there are more about data science and messing with model zoo type of shit than actually coding useful programs.

    "text": "I’m not sure that elementary calculus is particularly related to machine learning (I have a similar opinion of linear algebra which is fundamentally geometric in a way that machine learning isn’t). That doesn’t mean that you don’t need to know anything about calculus or matrix multiplication to understand machine learning but knowing eg Green’s theorem won’t help and neither will understanding a tensor as a multi linear map or in the way a general relativity physicist might. I also don’t particularly know what goes into calculus (in the U.K. we studied something called ‘calculus’ in high school which included integrating&#x2F;differentiating polynomials, some trig functions, easy integration by parts and, in the ‘further maths’ course, some second order linear ODEs with forcing, first order ODEs via integrating factors, first order linear systems of ODEs via the eigenvectors method, and I think some integration by parts based recurrence relations. At university things were divided into ‘calculus’, which contained practical tools for applied maths like Green’s theorem or partial derivatives or contour integration or Sturm–Liouville theory, and ‘analysis’ which had foundational things like epsilon–delta stuff or Dedekind cuts or the definition of a limit or Riemann integration or the conformal mapping theorem and so on. I think a first course in the thing I called analysis above is very useful for building mathematical maturity (ie the ability to not deduce false things but also playing with definitions and thinking about counter-examples) but the calculus knowledge can be useful for understanding the physical world. But I don’t know if that understanding should be required for e.g. computer scientists. A few calculus examples I can think of in computer science: - Some famous story of Feynman ‘interning’ at Thinking Machines and solving some capacity management problem using bizarre differential equations with terms representing e.g. ‘bits per second’. No sufficiently good solutions had been found using discrete methods. - I was once asked an interview question which I suggested solving with differential equations but I was quickly directed towards not doing that. - Honestly I can’t think of many more but maybe this is a lack of imagination. I think there are a few things that are really probability theory that you need some understanding of calculus for, e.g. emergent behaviour of distributed systems, reasons to prefer random cache eviction, some intuition to answer a question like ‘if the time X takes has some distribution, but sometimes we have a gc pause for y milliseconds, how would that affect the distribution?",

I think you get into calculus very quickly once you start dealing with uncertainty. A bit is 0 or 1, a discrete value. A random or unknown bit has some probability of being 1, a continuous value. A process that produces a random bit does too. An unknown such process has a distribution over such probabilities. Things like that are fundamental for things like communication or image classification. Also, though, a major application of computers is modeling and controlling the calculus-based physical world, just because they are so good at number crunching. Particularly popular examples are ray tracing, music synthesis, and motor control.",

There was a room set aside for people who wanted to bring and use typewriters but it was fairly hard to actually find a typewriter that they would allow. By the early &#x27;90s even low end typewriters often had several lines of buffer memory and an LCD display so that you could store and edit text before printing it, and higher end models were essentially specialized laptops that only ran a word processor and a printer driver. At my school if it had two or more lines of text storage it was considered to be a word processor or computer and not allowed.

When you have a test, you have something definite to prepare for. Even if you do not have dedicated mentors or well-wishing, caring teachers, you simply know there is a test that significantly improves your chances for MIT. When you don&#x27;t have a test, you have to study all the year round, do all homeworks, be active members of math, chess, or debate club all the year round and win at least province-level competitions, play an instrument at the school band, be elected the class monitor, create social equity clubs, do social service and so on. Which path do you think will be easier for someone from an impoverished, troubled background? Is it easier to prepare for a test for three months or be a whole different person severely constrained by your background? Whom does no-test policies benefit? The rich White student living in a gated community, or a Black&#x2F;Hispanic person living in slum-like condition? ____ I have little first hand experience (was born in a middle-of-nowhere small town, but wasn’t truly poor), and a lot of second-hand experience. I know a lot of friends, acquaintances who moved up the socio-economic ladder just because test-score based admission policies existed. The people who promote no-test policies are deluded ivory-tower dwellers detached from reality.",

I half-assed my entire way through high school, but studied for about a month for the ACT and did extremely well (perfect in all categories except Math, which I got a 32 in). I didn&#x27;t get into MIT (I never applied) but I did get into a few other relatively well-regarded universities (Auburn, NYU) despite my awful grades, almost exclusively riding off the strength of my ACT scores, and ended up going to Florida State (since it was cheaper than the other two I listed). I dropped out after 2 years (nearly flunking out due to low grades). To me, this showed that the tests are not an accurate measurement of how successful someone will be at college, but instead just how well someone can prepare for a specific test. If that&#x27;s the case, why add the extra cost, both time and money-wise? If a mediocre student can just cram for a few weeks and do well on the test, then it seems to me that it&#x27;s not a great test. I acknowledge that this is pure anecdata, but that was my perspective, not &quot;minorities can&#x27;t be expected to do well on anything objective&quot; and not &quot;I don&#x27;t want Yale to be 2&#x2F;3 asian.&quot;",

My kids did sports in high school - but the busses don&#x27;t take kids to and from the school in the off-hours that sport practices take place, so I had to drive them in early and pick them up late. That was an option for me - it wouldn&#x27;t have been for my dad. The only reason they made the teams in the first place, also, was because they had been doing rec league sports since they were little kids and were already competitive going into high school (we knew plenty of kids who tried out for the teams and didn&#x27;t make it). We&#x27;ve sunk who knows how much money into private lessons&#x2F;coaching&#x2F;one-on-ones, etc. None of this would have been possible for my parents, even if we&#x27;d been the type of family that did that sort of thing.",

The minute you need to start introducing test doubles, spies, or mocks, you&#x27;re abusing interface{}. Compared to Ruby&#x27;s rspec or even Python&#x27;s pytest where creating these objects is fairly straightforward, writing new code with Golang often feels like a chore. I get that a lot of this difficulty stems from Go being a compiled language, but I still wish that writing tests were easier. (I&#x27;m really thankful that Ginkgo and Gomega exist though!)",

The feasibility of neural networks trained up on vast data sets means we have non-human systems with hunches. That is, we have AIs capable of delivering results without explanations. Take a look at Neal Stephenson&#x27;s recent &quot;Fall&quot; for a social network that uses AI to generate &quot;news&quot; stories where the training metric is engagement.

Human hunches are often accompanied by a sense of ethics. The agricultural savant who sexes hatchling baby chickens knows the success of the farm depends on a low error rate. The judge sentencing a culprit knows the consequence of making mistakes. I wonder how hard it would be to add a sense of ethics to neural network results? Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of managing the error rates. But this article suggests otherwise.",

That is, git just claims the states combined without stopping in the same lines of the same files. There merge has to be verified by a user, from its perspective.) Games, similarly, typically have a master state server. Yes, they optimistically show some state locally, but the entire process checkpoints with a central state constantly. (Else you get jerky behaviors pretty quickly as the states diverge more and more in ways that can&#x27;t be reconciled without committing to a branch over another.)

The result may often be coherent at the sentence level if the edits are normal human edits, but often will not be at the whole-document level. For a simplistic example, if one person changes a frequently-used term throughout the document, and another person uses the old term in a bunch of places when writing new content, the document will be semantically inconsistent, even though all users made semantically consistent changes and are now seeing the same eventually-consistent document. For a contrived example of local inconsistency, consider the phrase &quot;James had a bass on his wall.&quot; Alice rewrites this to &quot;James had a bass on his wall, a trophy from his fishing trip last summer,&quot; and Brianna separately chooses &quot;James, being musically inclined, had hung his favorite bass on his wall.&quot; The CRDT dutifully applies both edits, and resolves this as: &quot;James, being musically inclined, had hung his favorite bass on his wall, a trophy from his fishing trip last summer.&quot; In nearly any system, semantic data is not completely represented by any available data model. Any automatic conflict-resolution model, no matter how smart, can lead to semantically-nonsensical merges. CRDTs are very very cool. Too often, though, people think that they can substitute for manual review and conflict resolution.",

Instead they truly and utterly obliterate the digital conflict resolution problem: a group of people editing a document can separately lose network connectivity, use different network transports, reconvene as a subgroup of the original editors... and their collective edits will always be resolved automatically by software into a deterministic document that fits within the original schema.

Does it make sense for us as an opensource community to invest our time and energy making one really good CRDT (with implementations in a few languages). Or does it make sense for us to distribute that energy between a bunch of CRDT and OT implementations, with different performance tradeoffs? My take is that its been hugely beneficial to us all that JSON is a standard, because I can use it from every language, and have confidence that the implementations are fast and good quality. I think we have an opportunity to make that for a good CRDT too. Even if OT would work fine in your architecture, if we have a great, capable, fast CRDT kicking around, it could be a reasonable default for most people. And my claim is that the performance difference between CRDTs and OT is smaller than the difference between high and low quality implementations.

For now these are some well known trade-offs A central server: Most OT algorithms depend on a central system for intention preservation. CRDTs are truly distributed and need no central server at all. Memory: Traditionally CRDTs consume more memory because deletions are preserved. OT lets you garbage collect some operations since a central system is already recording those ops and sequencing them as well. Analysing and cancelling ops: OT lets you easily analyse incoming ops and modify&#x2F;dummy-ify&#x2F;cancel them without breaking the consistency. This convenience is not necessary for most cases, but really important for rich-text editing. For example when someone merges a couple of table cells when another user is deleting a column, we need to analyze these operations and modify them so as not to end-up with an invalid table structure.",

So there&#x27;s either papers or tutorials, but nothing in-between. E.g. a different-angle explanation of the same thing, or comparison with another tech who came from that. In contrast, I like way more a different approach on explaining (mostly see it on Cyrillic forums) -- instead of guiding you by hand, they just give you clues where to look for. That way, knowledge givers are way more approachable, because it costs them very little to chat back something like &quot;look for CRDT&quot;, than go into in-depth explaining.

    "text": "CoCalc is a collaborative replacement of Jupyter notebooks. It&#x27;s a top-to-bottom re-implementation of the entire Jupyter stack designed specifically for realtime collaboration. You can use it via our hosted offering ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cocalc.com ), or install it on prem via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sagemathinc&#x2F;cocalc-docker . We released the our collaborative Jupyter notebook in 2014 as a plugin to Jupyter classic. We then iterated on what we learned over the years, completely rewriting everything multiple times, including the entire realtime collaboration stack. Cocalc&#x27;s Jupyter support is pretty mature and battle tested at this point, and also includes a TimeTravel slider that lets you view all past versions of a Jupyter notebook and integrated chat. I was a college professor (at Univ of Washington), I started a company around this in 2015, so CoCalc has soo far been mainly aimed at serving the needs of academics teaching courses. It&#x27;s been increasingly popular lately, e.g., in the last month over a half million distinct Jupyter notebooks were edited on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cocalc.com . Of course, many of these notebooks are homework problems. Anyway, our company is doing very well, and we hope it will eventually be a &quot;10M startup opportunity&quot;. :-)",

Technically, if they&#x27;re able to dynamically translate x86 to ARM as they&#x27;ve explicitly stated (with JIT of JS and the JVM as the example) they should be able to dynamically translate x86 VMs regardless of what OS they contain, which would allow x86 Windows to be virtualized with better-than-interpreted performance. Or at least that&#x27;s what I hope ;-) I&#x27;m relying on running x86 Windows and Linux within Parallels in addition to native MacOS Apps to do my daily work, which involves compiling and testing x86 binaries for these platforms, so whether this virtualization thing actually runs x86 OSes transparently is an absolute make-or-break feature for me to continue my usage of the MacOS platform for work.",

When I have a monologue running, the most common content is trying out and editing drafts of sentences meant to express thoughts or feelings that have arisen without words. I&#x27;ve worked as a technical writer for somewhere around half of my career. I wonder if that career and my frequent self-editing are somehow causally related (in one direction or the other). Also, I occasionally seem to stop thinking entirely and just experience sensations, perceptions, and sometimes emotions. I rather like those intervals, and am prone to try to sort of savor them. They generally don&#x27;t last very long before thoughts start popping up again. I went to a Buddhist college for a while, and the curriculum included quite a lot of meditation. I wonder sometimes if those episodes without apparent thought are related in some way to the many hours of sitting I did (and still sometimes do). I don&#x27;t really know, though. Maybe all that sitting taught me how to allow thinking to peter out. Or maybe it taught me to notice when it does and not interfere with the process. Or maybe it&#x27;s completely unrelated.",

One person even mentioned that when they do voice overs in movies of people’s thoughts, they “wished that it was real.” I think this author has an inaccurate understanding of people who do not have an &quot;auditory&quot; inner monologue. Think of it this way: a lot of people don&#x27;t vocalize text as they read it. I do not. I am still able to read, and I still &quot;understand&quot; what is being read, but I don&#x27;t need to turn it into voices and sound it out, to gain that understanding. Tbh, I find it slows me down. Inner monologues are the same way. People still have rich inner &quot;conversations&quot; even if they aren&#x27;t vocal ones. Which is what I do -- I&#x27;m not really sure the best way to describe it, but I&#x27;m able to have a &quot;debate&quot; between inner arguments without mocking it out as two people talking to each other (I mean, I can if I want to -- but I find it unnecessary and slow, personally). I&#x27;m sure a lot of people are the same way.

    "text": "What about visualizing the picture of a face ? Or alternatively, like you seem to be able to visualize 3d structures, can you imagine a wax or clay sculpture of the face of the person (i.e. if you have a sculpture laying around which has a face take a look at it and try to visualize it in your head), or a coin head profile. Once you get it to successfully visualize with one way morph it continuously into the case you don&#x27;t successfully visualize yet and push the frontier. For example if you get it to work with a small sculpture try it with a bigger one. Or try to look at a real person face as if it was a sculpture or an object. Try changing the way you gaze at the face. Sometimes, even more so with people we care about, we don&#x27;t look at them like we would look at an object but we are rather trying to look at the soul behind the mask.",

    "text": "You noted the possibility that you might have mental images or monologue but don&#x27;t experience them. That&#x27;s interesting. I expect someone will object that it&#x27;s logically contradictory to propose that you have an inner monologue but don&#x27;t experience it; I don&#x27;t think it is, actually. I get migraines. I&#x27;ve experienced them for about forty-five years. They&#x27;re not just headaches. They&#x27;re some kind of unusual neural and vascular activity in the brain that can cause a whole slew of weird effects. One effect that I&#x27;ve experienced many times is called scotoma . It&#x27;s a phenomenon where a region of the visual field is taken over by a vivid abstract pattern. Scotomas take various shapes, but they generally have a few things in common: they are more vivid than real seen objects; they often flicker rapidly and may move slowly; they often have high-contrast black-and-white-striped zigzag patterns; they may be surrounded by faint or vivid colorful auras that pulse or stream. I&#x27;ve seen lots of scotomas over the years with all of these attributes. One time just a few years ago I was reading a good book and I began to notice the mild visual distortions that alert me to an oncoming scotoma. There&#x27;s nothing much I can do about them, and I was really interested in the book, so I sort of shrugged and figured I&#x27;d continue reading until I had to stop. I never had to stop. The scotoma came on full-force and took over the center of my visual field. I couldn&#x27;t see anything except the scotoma directly in front of me. Nevertheless, I was able to continue reading without any trouble. Well, the scotoma was distracting, but it didn&#x27;t prevent me from reading. As you can imagine, I found this really weird. If you don&#x27;t believe me, I don&#x27;t really blame you. I found it so surprising that I started reading the book aloud, as if that would somehow serve as a reasonable test that I wasn&#x27;t simply making up the contents of the book without realizing it. I continued reading. The scotoma eventually faded away, and I could confirm that, yes, the pages I had read while I couldn&#x27;t see them were just as I had heard myself reading them aloud. This experience suggests to me that seeing the book is one process, but consciously experiencing the seeing of it is another, completely separate, process. The migraine sabotaged my ability to consciously experience seeing the book, but it didn&#x27;t interfere with the process of actually seeing or reading it. If that&#x27;s true, it suggests that the process of running an internal monologue, or of constructing internal images, could be separate from the process of being conscious of them. Perhaps you indeed have an internal monologue and you simply don&#x27;t experience it?",

Some failed parses are funny, or they might prompt me to substitute homophones in a search for a parse that works. Sometimes the results make me laugh, and that can lead to occasional awkwardness.",

My wife found this pretty weird. I suspect it&#x27;s related to my also experiencing aphantasia.

I can&#x27;t think of any reason why you couldn&#x27;t have a kind of state of lucid wakefulness effectively functioning as an overlay of what your sense organs are telling you. Imagine for example a race car driver who sees the line as clearly as in one of the simulation games that enables it. Edit: I&#x27;ve also had vivid hypnagogic visual hallucinations intentionally. It&#x27;s a kind of fun game to play, seeing my bedroom clearly with my eyes closed, or checking the time on my watch while same. Obviously I&#x27;m conscious and aware that I&#x27;m not really checking the actual time, but not particularly surprisingly I&#x27;m pretty close since I tend to wake about the same time every day.",

    "text": "Well, isn&#x27;t this something. Lots to consider (and I&#x27;m behind on all the comments atm.) I worked in aviation operations for a number of years (prior profession) and lived and breathed UTC. I wrote this then, so it&#x27;s ... from last century. (Not in the wayback machine anywhere. I had to dig it back up.) &gt;&gt;&gt;THE UNIVERSAL CLOCK : EXPLAINED by The AceyMan Most anyone who can read a language (as you are doing now) is familiar with &#x27;time&#x27; and &#x27;timekeeping&#x27;. This short essay hopes to explain the concept of non-local, or universal time, and promote its standardization. Until 1993, the clock that was set as a reference for all local time zones was kept in the United Kingdom. Due to its position at the Greenwich meridian, it was refered to as &#x27;Greenwich Mean Time&#x27;, or GMT. This clock was the world standard for all time zones, and never changes, ie, no savings time, no adjustments, except for accuracy. It is _defined_ as the world standard for time. So, when a nation or geographical area decides what local time is, they still must have a reference to set it against. (Time is relative, remember). GMT is that standard. For example, in the eastern United States, local (non-daylight) time is 5 hours behind GMT. That is to say, if GMT is 1800 hours (and yes, it uses a 24 hour, or &#x27;military&#x27; clock), then US eastern time would be 1300 hours, ie, 1800-500=1300 or 1:00 pm. Now the confusion with local time occurs mainly when either of two things happens. First, when a person moves from time zone to timezone frequently and must make constant calculations to determine what time it &#x27;really&#x27; is, or how long he&#x27;s been awake, driving, burning fuel, running his computer, accruing hours, charging his customers, or any various other important numbers. This is frequent in transportation, especially aviation, where many time zones may be traversed in a short period. Second, when one is working with a worldwide communications system and may be talking with persons outside of your local timezone, sometimes FAR OUTSIDE your local time zone. In this case, GMT is especially useful, because by referring to GMT, one can still know what time that person is referring to, without asking where he is. For example, if you know what GMT is, and I know what GMT is, and I say, &quot;I have to leave to go to a meeting at 1400 GMT&quot;, then the other person knows when that person will be leaving. S&#x2F;he won’t have to ask &quot;well, what&#x27;s your local time now, so I can figure out how long it is before you go&quot;. GMT spares all parties from such time-consuming calculations. GMT should, and this author hopes WILL BE the clock for the world in the near future, as it should be. We owe the widespread use of global communications, particularly the Internet, for this expectation. ### I stand by most of that now (but I would do at least one rewrite says older me, heh). Doing time sums and differences on the fly across multiple time zones is loco. For both fuel and personnel planning. It&#x27;s not just weather reports and ETD&#x2F;ETA times. We are crunching time ALL time in air ops, and you have to have a pinned baseline. I think the time has long past to go unified. Then the only question you have to ask someone is &quot;What&#x27;s your UTC offset?&quot; E.g., in your .plan file or S4B header text. Problem handled. &#x2F;Acey [edit: unix errata]",

    "text": "Verbatim, Most Recent, and clustered posts are all better for a mindset when you have a relatively specific query, or at least filter bias, in mind. Consider the following statements: 1) I&#x27;m looking for something specific. 2) I&#x27;d rather not be surprised right now. 3) I&#x27;d like to get through the search&#x2F;index as fast as possible to get where I&#x27;m going. The above are user-voiced versions of principles that drive traditional UI, and are absolutely better met by that optimization process. AI-driven search and feeds were exciting because they were the first method that captured use cases where users wouldn&#x27;t make those statements: fuzzy queries about general interests, the desire for diversions &quot;curated&quot; by your own social group, and search&#x2F;feed review as itself as an entertaining experience. Then, it turned out that these unexplored use cases were actually the giant, underwater part of the iceburg of what people wanted from information systems. The growth and attention capture you can drive from meeting those cases is not only massive, it sucks the oxygen out of traditional value propositions by out-competing for the same attention. I think a return to traditional &quot;capture and facilitate intent&quot; UI (or even better a synthesis of the two!) will only be driven by users finding a way to explicitly value their own clarity of attention. We see signs of this in everything from ad blockers to focus-oriented browser plug-ins, but I think we&#x27;re still missing the FOMO-conquering expression of this value proposition that becomes a competitive product.",

I certainly did not chose my profession from a profit motive and neither did most of the people I know. We did what we did because that is what we like or enjoy. Of course practical issues of making a living wage factors in. I make a high salary now, but that is rather by accident. I just happened to be good in STEM subjects and enjoy math and programming. I didn&#x27;t pursue it because it was an optimal economic decision. I can fully relate to Elon Musk. When I try to pick a programming job e.g. I factor in many things such as salary, colleagues, location etc, but actually how useful the product seems is a major factor for me. I am generally willing to sacrifice salary to do something which I feel helps humanity more. E.g. I&#x27;d day a pay cut to develop a medical application over a horse betting application. Of course money isn&#x27;t irrelevant. If there is just too little money in medical software then I&#x27;d suck it up and sell my soul to betting, big oil or whatever ;-)",

I think your comment would be more relevant for the libertarian argument that CEOs need to be paid bucketloads of money, or the idea that rich people deserve all their riches because they did it all by themselves. I don&#x27;t really think Elon is a guy that thinks he built everything himself. I have more an issue with conservative politicians who will not acknowledge that great organizations and businesses are team efforts and that all member of society should be appreciated, not just those on the top. Elon like many great leaders before him is accomplish great things because he recognizes talent and allow talented people to do what they are good at. Too many talented people are held down by their leaders. Of course if Elon was placed in Somalia he would have accomplished nothing. The talents and infrastructure he needs to do great things would not have been there. It is American society which has given him the opportunities he has exploited.",

Capitalism moves in the direction of where the money is - and the money is in things people want. So capitalism is a most efficient machine to produce things for the greater good.

Also, it seems entirely reasonable to me that any market distortion implies an opportunity cost - that aggregate happiness; over time, would be greater; if we spent a little less on footballers and a little more on e.g. imho; carbon capture! You even explicitly state that it would be extremely judgemental to blame individuals - i.e. footballers - for maximising their individual happiness at the expense of human society as a whole; and that instead this should be blamed on a market or political failure.",

One could very easily conduct serious genetic engineering in one&#x27;s bedroom for less that $500 or so. Of course this is fairly basic stuff, but still, you&#x27;d be amazed what is possible with very little equipment. For example, there is a yearly competition called iGEM, which is synthetic biology competition for undergrads. Some of the stuff they do with limited resources is quite impressive. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;igem.org&#x2F;Main_Page",

I think Elon is doing the best he can working on the problems that are available for him to work on. To me, one wrong problem is anything that perpetuates the automobile&#x2F;road system as is. I think the whole thing needs to be completely rebuilt. To me the enormity of our problems from a sustainability standpoint are so great that anything but a massive mobilization and shift in our way of life is arranging deck chairs on the titanic. I think that religion was a science of mobilizing public opinion, and I think science has replaced it, and has yet to do as good a job, and has yet to recognize that fact. I think the right problem is how to manage mass social&#x2F;cultural change in a very brief period of time. I&#x27;ll say again, Elon is doing a fantastic job within the paradigm of our current industrialized cultural norms, which says that we can keep on with business as usual and make some adjustments to our systems ... but I think it&#x27;s not enough by an order of magnitude, and so that&#x27;s why I think minds like Elon&#x27;s should be working on manufacturing a social&#x2F;cultural reality that prepares us for a huge change in lifestyle. To me that&#x27;s a problem of social engineering, same as religion, and same as building a company, and Elon excels at it.",

So, if the &#x27;PayPal tax&#x27; is unacceptable to you, the &quot;visionary&quot; thing to do would be, figure out what the root causes of that tax are, figure out why they are unnecessary and how much correcting them will move the needle.

People are just much more likely to comment if they hate something than if they love something. Also if they disagree with something than if they agree. Comments in any online forum are not a uniform sampling of the views of the readers.

Most people make decisions about their careers based on opportunity and maximising profit. No one becomes a footballer to make the world a better place. This would all be fine as long as the capitalist market rewarded choices that make the world a better place. Obviously it does not and it&#x27;s not the fault of a footballer that we as a civilisation choose to channel our available resources their way and not towards frivolous play like space exploration. If anyone ever figures out a way to make the free market choose the greater good they will win all the Nobel prizes forever (we won&#x27;t need Nobel prizes after that).",

    "text": "I&#x27;m not sure you would. I mean, I&#x27;m sure you could somehow, but at this point so much of what needs to be done is basic research, and really can be done well in that context. There aren&#x27;t many things that are ready to leave the context of a research lab and into commercialization. We&#x27;ve got some notable disasters with Theranos, and even the YC funded Taxa (glowing plant - that was a farce from the get-go, but they&#x27;re doing some potentially interesting stuff now). As far as education, it&#x27;s not something you can learn by yourself, it just isn&#x27;t. Most of the methods in a biological wet lab are very far from standardized and need a great deal of troubleshooting. Most post-docs in a new lab spend a couple months just trying to get basic stuff working that they&#x27;ve done dozens of times before. It&#x27;s hard . You need people around you with experience and perspective, and doctorate programs are likely the only place you&#x27;re going to get that kind of training. I think there are a lot of people that want to approach biology with a CS mindset, especially the people interested in synthetic biology, but that rarely bears fruit. It could get to that place eventually, but there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover. In that sense I agree with Elon that, despite the huge impact genetic engineering could have, it&#x27;s not the next thing because we&#x27;re not ready yet. There&#x27;s still too much that&#x27;s fundamental to biological problems that we simply don&#x27;t understand, and solving things in one species usually doesn&#x27;t translate very far across taxa.",

Once you get data in a reasonable format you can help them with transforming it&#x2F;joining it with other sources&#x2F;cleaning them up. ETLs and data integration are often completely foreign concepts to them. And that&#x27;s researchers, you might still start calling them quite computer-competent after you talk to the people in the clinic. All the research is for nothing if it&#x27;s not brought to &quot;bedside&quot; to benefit the patients in a clinical setting, outside all trials. For that you need to make sure genomics pipelines are automated and reproducible and only clinically relevant information gets to the oncologists (or other doctors) deciding on treatment. This is still not quite there even in the best places. I think most of the really world-changing stuff will just be hard work on relatively easy problems. It&#x27;s hard to get excited about these (compared to the latest neural networks or distributed high performance systems) but they need to get done",

In that role, maybe they make lots of decisions, maybe they write things like &quot;Part Deux&quot;, or maybe they stand around an scream a lot. Whatever works; probably a little of all of the above, and a good CEO knows when to use which approach. At some level they may also report to a board, who helps them, or replaces them, all based on their execution success. And at another level, they report to shareholders who do the same.",

For example, all the things &quot;he&quot; did above were actually done by big teams of people working together, but Elon gets all the credit. He deserves credit, but not all of it. And let&#x27;s not forget the millions of people who worked to generate wealth that could be transferred via, and taxed by, PayPal, accruing the fortune with which to start all these projects in the first place. If I didn&#x27;t &quot;know better&quot; I&#x27;d be tempted to conclude that the luck of being in the right place at the right time with a good idea, is the main difference between Elon and the rest, or at least that any intrinsic differences are not as great as you might think. Heck I&#x27;m a &quot;visionary&quot; too, just add one billion dollars and tons of free time and see what I come up with! (Campaign coming soon to Kickstarter, LOL) Man is at once animal and rational, and sometimes the rational side reacts against our own animalistic urge to designate an alpha ape and worship only that one ape. Many of us got into technology as a way of breaking down this same kind of bullshit hierarchy that you can find in so many other places &amp; domains of human life. Technology was supposed to be the great equalizer. In some cases it has worked that way but in others it has only amplified the disequilibrium. It seems we can&#x27;t escape our inner ape. Therefore is it &quot;technologists&quot; to whom you should be appealing here for greater reverence? Maybe it&#x27;s not your technological side, but your ape side, that wants to be more reverent.",

Whether he likes it or not, he is the figurehead and the focal point. Because he&#x27;s willing to be that, it builds on itself. Because he&#x27;s in a valuation-driven growth-only economy on which his businesses depend, it&#x27;s in his interest to serve as this focal point, and because &#x27;visionary&#x27; is an appealing story, the feedback loop gets set up and whirls into motion. I think he is so much of a nerd that it doesn&#x27;t change him all that much. I like him better for that, but it&#x27;s true he doesn&#x27;t deserve the amount of credit he&#x27;s given, simply because that&#x27;s unrealistic. But, if he CEASES to be &#x27;that guy&#x27; and &#x27;the visionary sole leader and innovator&#x27;, it&#x27;s less of an appealing story, and his businesses would suffer. He is surfing on a wave of attention which sustains the valuations of his companies, and using the valuation to invest in gigantic projects that may do a lot of good. Surf on, say I.",

It would take the Delta plant roughly a month to make that many. GM has ~15 equivalent plants worldwide. I love Tesla and am glad to see the NUMMI plant up and running again, but even their most ambitious sales plans for the next 10 years pale in comparison to business as usual for the major manufacturers. edit Curiosity got the better of me, so I looked up the 2015 sales figures for those 3 vehicles from that one plant. Acadia: 96,393; Traverse: 119,945; Enclave: 62,081. So roughly 280,000 SUVs produced at the one assembly plant last year without much fanfare.",

That said, if they have a submission process, expect to go through it. It&#x27;s entirely possibly they get a ton of useless submissions and inquiries through email, and part of their process is to ignore those. If an applicant can&#x27;t be bothered to go through the initial steps to get onto the short list for consideration, why should they think that&#x27;s a good candidate to be throwing money at, regardless of their resume?",

That&#x27;s a fair question. I&#x27;d like to ask a question in response: if an applicant has worked under&#x2F;helped&#x2F;seen those who could be bothered the jump through the hoops to get on the short of consideration and then funded, walked away because someone threw money at them to work on financial&#x2F;trading software (thus enabling and &quot;freed&quot; to pursued related research work in more detail in their spare time), why shouldn&#x27;t they throw money at such candidate despite considering how far throwing more of the same into neuroimaging research has gotten us thus far? Personally, jumping through arbitrary&#x2F;superficial hoops is not a game I want to play (plenty of others are good at that, and I wish them all the best, darpa&#x27;s latest and greatest ways at dealing with signal 2 noise issue is their problem, and anyone should feel free to point that out), I&#x27;m having much more fun playing my own game from my fancy apt all the away across the world, while still working with those don&#x27;t want to waste my time (and mine there&#x27;s). Luckly for others and folks like me, darpa aren&#x27;t the only folks interested, and money isn&#x27;t the only &quot;limited&quot; resource of consideration.",

When I play with ideas I just put a &#x27;x&#x27; on the G line with a superscript 4 next to it. Music theory could be taught in a way so that students learnt to find the G as a matter of course. But for some reason we&#x27;ve been beaten into thinking in terms of these two clefs. It might have something to do with the way a conductor reads full-score. With typesetting technology it should be mess important to have conductor and accompanist on the same clef. We&#x27;re not far from a point where everything could move to e-ink. It&#x27;ll probably take another century for music libraries to have been completely moved to digital.",

Our elegant, real-time dashboards solve an important, difficult problem for thousands of paying subscribers, by taking the complexity out of connecting to their data and making that data simple for everyone to interpret at a glance. As a result, our customers unlock data they didn&#x27;t know they had, connect people and join up projects, and make better decisions faster. We have a lot of exciting work in store and are looking for curious and creative problem solvers to help develop our product and take it to even more customers. You&#x27;ll be joining a friendly team with great people in an environment with empowered developers, flexible working conditions, and a focus on skill development. We are looking for full-time senior engineers, both front- and back-end. A variety of skills for modern, scalable web applications - e.g. Chef, React, Go, Ruby, Javascript - are of interest, but we like to have people learn on the job so don&#x27;t worry about any you might be missing. See our jobs page for details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geckoboard.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F; We’re constantly striving to ensure that we offer the most encouraging, supportive and efficient environment possible. We want everyone on the team to influence our architectural decisions. The whole team is involved in prioritising and evaluating our work and we regularly program in pairs to share knowledge, promote collaboration, and improve our code quality. We don&#x27;t just pay lip service to work-life balance, we actively and strongly encourage it. Flexible working hours and the ability to regularly work from home let you work in a way that fits you and your family. We see our contractual obligation to offer 25 days&#x27; paid holiday as a &#x2F;lower&#x2F; bound for everyone in the organisation, not a limit. We actively contribute to personal and professional development and have a minimum budget allowance to be spent on courses, conferences, and books. We also run fortnightly &quot;innovation days&quot;, where everyone has complete freedom to work on anything that interests them, from contributing to open-source projects, learning a new skill, or improving our internal tools and processes.",

Twitter has found its niche users: somehow web developers, designers and indie game developers seem to love it. But if you have to explain to non tech-savy people more than 5 minutes why they should use it, then it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s not for everyone.

    "text": "&gt; In theory, you might be correct. But practice is much different. I&#x27;m quite familiar with real union IT positions that exist now (and are even more bureaucratically limited than the minimum for union positions, because they are also public sector positions), and they don&#x27;t require this &quot;everyone in a given title in a department must have the same wage&quot;. &gt; My Uncle wanted to get a raise. He couldn&#x27;t just ask for one. He had to go to the Union board who then had to talk to company management to not only give him a raise, but everyone else in his department that had the same position. This is what I&#x27;m talking about. Sure, there may be some union contracts, for some type of jobs, which require everyone in a firm with the same classification to be paid exactly the same. And, yes, union contracts as a rule prohibit individually-negotiated compensation, even where (as they usually do) they permit individual variations in compensation (usually, with defined criteria and processes.) That&#x27;s kind of the whole point of collective bargaining.",

Our goal is to enable firms to do so by providing access to the cutting-edge statistical models of co-founder Wharton Professor Peter Fader that forecast customer behavior far into the future. To accomplish this goal and allow companies to implement customer-centric marketing strategies, our world-class team of statisticians, marketers, and data scientists is building an enterprise-grade cloud-based analytics suite to commercialize our own award-winning research on consumer behavior, marketing theory, and statistics. Our founding team has the technical expertise for the back-end (C++ and R), and we are looking to add an expert full stack developer to the team to help us design, code, and ultimately manage the system architecture as we deploy our product. Currently, our stack runs on AWS with Python (Flask) and AngularJS on the front end. Experience with database architecture for big data applications is a huge plus. The key issues that we will face are: -Infrastructure security: We’re touching some of a corporation&#x27;s most sensitive data -System robustness: This will be mission-critical software for a company as they will base numerous marketing decisions on the information -Scalability: We will be working with massive data sets (millions of customers and hundreds of millions of transactions) and computationally intensive models If you&#x27;re looking for new engineering challenges, please contact justin@clvmetrics.com.",

If a hard drive was replaced and you needed to install Windows 10, you would have to either (a) install the full version - which would require a purchase; or (b) install an earlier version and go through the upgrade process again. The problem there is that Microsoft may only allow one upgrade per license key, in which case your previous upgrade voided that license key for future upgrades. It would be similar to having Windows XP running on your system and wanting to upgrade to Windows 7. You go out purchase the upgrade license (cheaper) so you can perform the upgrade. A few months later your hard drive crashes, you try to install from the upgrade license and are out of luck. You need to go through the upgrade process again or have a full version available.",

    "text": "It&#x27;s hard to be sure why exactly shared libraries and dynamic linking appeared. Your explanation about reducing file size for smaller HDD and RAM footprint is probably one of the reasons, but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the only one - I don&#x27;t remember many shared libraries from MSDOS days (where with 2MB of RAM and 40MB of HDD, storage was really scarce). In fact - I don&#x27;t remember any libraries! To run Doom you just borrowed the floppies from a friend and it would 100% work. The same for Warcraft 1. I believe it&#x27;s more similar to Database Normalization from RDBMS world than to anything else. And the most important objective of Database Normalization is considered &quot;Freeing the database of modification anomalies&quot;. My own experience with shared libraries is pretty positive. I have fixed OpenSSL vulnerabilities many times by just updating the OpenSSL library and restarting all services. Compared to my own experience with docker where after waiting for a few weeks I had to change my base images (as nobody was updating them) updating just a single shared library and having the vulnerability fixed is way easier! This, of course, is true if those who maintain the software you use do care about backwards compatibility (which tends to be true for the &quot;boring&quot; stuff and false for the stuff considered &quot;cool&quot; - looking at you nodejs library developers who break my build at least once a month).",

    "text": "&gt; This is clearly wrong - I demonstrated a stupidly simple alternate theory which disagrees with the consensus, but still lacks constant power shifts. Your theory didn&#x27;t even explain the data (in the software industry), and had nothing to say about power. Basically, it can comfortably exist beside the consensus theory as a second-order effect (and the data actually looks like that is probably the case, explaining representation differences of up to 2:1). &gt; So why cling to that theory, rather than, say, my theory of p=A - B x math_content + second_order_corrections? Two reasons: 1. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the anomalous software industry (neither the very low participation nor the sudden change) while the consensus theory does, and 2. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the lack of representation (and possible correction after well-documented struggles) in fields of high prestige and little math (such as law, medicine and politics). In all those fields: law, medicine, politics and software, women participation was (or is) far lower than 30%. It was&#x2F;is lower than 20%. You might think that singling out software is uninteresting from a statistical perspective, as in Scott Alexander&#x27;s regression it was just a single (outlier) data point, but in fact, the software industry is larger than all &quot;heavy math content&quot; professions combined, and holds more power in today&#x27;s society. &gt; My theory predicts more things (e.g., it predicts % women in academia, % women in finance, % women in tech vs non-tech roles) and is vastly simpler. How is that not a win? Because it predicts fewer things, and not even what you claim it does. At best, it predicts fewer women than men in certain subjects, but that&#x27;s it. However, we see that while the binary relation &quot;fewer&quot; may remain, how much fewer decreases over time. Second, it only holds (even as a binary prediction) when you look at the past few decades -- far too short to look at social change -- which means it does not explain the exclusion of women from law, medicine and politics. Third, it does not explain the way-too-low representation in CS, nor the drop in participation. The consensus theory explains all of it, for any time duration. It even explains interesting shifts we see in, say, education (more women as prestige drops, while in CS fewer women as prestige rises). Yes, it&#x27;s more complicated, but fits reality better, plus it&#x27;s supported by lots and lots of data.",

Women participation in math and the physical sciences is extremely high relative to their participation in software, where it used to be much, much higher (same as in other professions) and is constantly declining. That decline actually coincides with increasing, rather than decreasing salaries and prestige, and is not due to increasing work hours (that are lower in software than in medicine and law, where women participation is high). Software is a very clear anomaly. That theory is even wrong for science in general, especially considering that women participation has been increasing, and that some scientific fields -- that are just as demanding -- are actually dominated by women.",

    "text": "&gt; Any theory which predicts that math&#x2F;physics&#x2F;cs&#x2F;EE has few women is inherently flawed if it doesn&#x27;t also predict that medicine&#x2F;law&#x2F;advertising have plenty of women. I am not sure where you&#x27;re going with this, but you can&#x27;t make such a comparison at a given moment in time. The reason is that struggles usually follow power, and so it is likely that at any point in time, a marginalized group would concentrate its efforts to penetrate positions that imbue power. As the power structure shifts, so does the struggle. You can&#x27;t equate professions that hold different amounts of power at different times. Certainly up until some decades ago, law and medicine carried much more prestige and influence -- and hence, power -- than math and the physical sciences. In fact, software&#x27;s gain of prestige correlates quite well with the drop in women participation. It is quite anomalous in that the existence of the field long predated its power. Law and medicine, OTOH, are professions that have been seats of power for almost a millennium. A model that correlates low female participation with high power -- and later, increased participation after a struggle -- predicts both observations. It is not such a surprising or sophisticated theory; historians have seen this pattern so often that it is almost banal. This pattern is so regular, that it&#x27;s relatively easy for us to predict the future: fifty years from now, assuming the power wielded by software remains high, women participation will equal men&#x27;s, and it will be hard for people to believe that that hasn&#x27;t always been the case. Unfortunately, even though the result of the fight is certain, we still need to fight it. That is the price history exacts from us.",

    "text": "This site was incredibly slow for me to connect to. Just in case the server goes down here&#x27;s the text of the article. I will remove this if requested. Mirror for the ctrl+f folks ---------------------------------- Windows 10&#x27;s New Feature Steals Your Internet Bandwidth A couple of days ago I discussed a number of privacy and other concerns with Microsoft&#x27;s new Windows 10, made available as a free upgrade for many existing MS users: Windows 10: A Potential Privacy Mess, and Worse: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lauren.vortex.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;001115.html The situation has only been getting worse since then. For example, it&#x27;s been noted that the Win10 setup sequence is rigged to try fool users into switching to an MS browser, irrespective of their browser settings before they started the upgrade: Mozilla isn’t happy with Microsoft for changing how users change the default web browser in Windows 10: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft-news.com&#x2F;mozilla-isnt-happy-with-microsoft-... Pretty bad. But we have even lower to go, as we&#x27;ve seen that by default, Windows 10 actually steals bandwidth from your ISP connection so that Microsoft can use your computer, and your connection, to send MS updates to their other customers. Huh? Say what? Yep. It&#x27;s a devious little feature called Windows Update Delivery Optimization. It&#x27;s enabled by default. For Enterprise and Education users, it operates over the local LAN. For ordinary Home type users, Microsoft can send their data update goodies to potentially any PC on the global Internet -- from your PC, over your Internet connection. On your dime. We could get into the pros and cons of local updates being staged between local machines on a LAN as opposed to the outside Internet. But as soon as MS decided that it&#x27;s A-OK for them to use my Internet connection to cut down on their bandwidth costs serving their other customers -- without asking me for my specific permission first -- the situation blows into the red zone immediately. Microsoft makes the predictable excuses about this high-tech thievery. There&#x27;s a way you can turn it off. Yeah, buried down deep in the settings, assuming you even know about it in the first place. MS claims they only use your connection when it&#x27;s &quot;idle&quot; by their definitions. Thanks a bunch. Oh yes, and (how generous of them!) Microsoft notes that they won&#x27;t steal bandwidth this way from &quot;metered&quot; connections. But here&#x27;s the catch -- you have to manually indicate that a connection shouldn&#x27;t be used for MS&#x27; update delivery scheme. Otherwise, Microsoft has no way to know if (for example) you&#x27;re paying by the gigabyte or have a low bandwidth cap. Above all, the sheer arrogance of Microsoft to enable this bandwidth theft by default is stunning. I don&#x27;t care if they want to move 1K or 1gig to their other happy users, I want to damn well be asked permission first! Obviously, this general category of peer-to-peer data transfer is used on the Net in other contexts, such as torrents for example -- but that&#x27;s something you do voluntarily, of your own volition. Comcast uses the bandwidth of many Comcast users to turn modems in people&#x27;s homes into public Wi-Fi access points. This has been highly controversial, but at least Comcast is typically doing it over modems they supplied, and has claimed that they over-provision the connection speeds to take this into account -- and don&#x27;t apply that public usage against home users&#x27; bandwidth caps. But Microsoft didn&#x27;t even bother with such rationalizations. They simply said in essence: &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got bandwidth, so we&#x27;re gonna use it however we please unless you tell us differently. Suckers!&quot; If you&#x27;re running Windows 10, you may want to terminate this travesty. The settings you need are buried down in: START-&gt;Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security-&gt;Windows Update-&gt;Advanced options, under: Choose how updates are delivered. It&#x27;s worth noting at this point that if Google had tried a stupid stunt like this, there would likely already be EU commissioners running through the streets of Brussels hoisting pitchforks and flaming torches, all yelling for Google&#x27;s blood. For a while there, it was starting to look like there indeed was a new kind of Microsoft coming into view, one that had evolved beyond the hubris that had so long been Microsoft&#x27;s single most defining characteristic. As we can see, any such hopes are now ... Gone with the Win10. --Lauren-- I have consulted to Google, but I am not currently doing so. All opinions expressed here are mine alone.",

    "text": "I&#x27;m really just tripping on nostalgia right now but fuck it someone might appreciate these details so I&#x27;m going to continue. I also remember playing so many good stuff on the Ti-83. We used to download Bubble bobble and even 3d wolfenstein and just slack off. Students did cheat using the Ti-83 by putting formulas and cheat notes. I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t ban it. It was expensive at the time too and I lost or broke mine twice. I&#x27;m not sure if all Canadian high schools were like ours but we had dedicated courses for learning everything from Qbasic to Maya. I was mad jealous of kids that were creating crazy 3d animations with 3ds max but the class was always filled very fast :(. Had I learned the stuff I might have become a computer graphics artist or something in that area. The course I took taught Visual Basic and then QBasic towards the end (I was like dayum I already know this at age 10, let me play web games while teacher is not looking). At lunch time computer graphics lab hosted Counter Strike (1.3 back then) where you paid a dollar to play for 45 minutes and sometimes after school it would go until for several hours. Like jam packed with 20 people screaming and shouting when somebody got knifed. You couldn&#x27;t curse tho because the instructor was a hard ass and kicked people out for typing swear words in the chat. Damn, we even had Battlefield 1942 tournaments. Ironically, being in a poorer school meant ton of corporate endorsements and goodies (free Vancouver Grizzlies tickets &amp; free lunch). During the mid 90s when I was in elementary school, our school had everything from Apple II to Imac. Like almost every Mac from different timeline. One of my favorite was a black &amp; white tiny monitor Apple that had Hypercard on it and I used to create something like dragonball Z stick figure animation (obviously inspired by stickdeath.com) on it. Fuck those were good times especially since I didn&#x27;t have a computer back then and the school provided all these things. In grade 6, our teacher was super supportive of us using technology (he was into tech, even bought a monochrome projector off ebay so he could teach material from the computer). Looking back I can see how fortunate it was to have experienced all these things. I was especially fond of playing games like Lode Runner and Lemonade Stand on the Apple II. Pretty much all of my recess and lunchtime was spent on figuring out 1) find games in dusty bins in school gym 2) figure out how to run it. Our school used to host Zip Zap Map Canada (tetris meets geography) tournaments. At home my dad taught me how to create my own website (so 1997 or 1998) using Netscape Composer (on win 95 or 98) and uploading it to a free host. Used to brag about it and impressed my teacher a lot. I picked up a book on HTML for dummies from the library and started reading about Javascript and Java but these books were in Korean and I had a tough time. Eventually geocities came along and it was day dreaming about making a popular website ( never happened :( ). During this time, we got fresh new iMacs and it was off to the races to find games to run on it, Bugdom, Nanosaur, Sim City Classic &amp; 2000, weird game where you walk around a dungeon and kill monsters and level up. We were also trying to run some weird emulation that supposedly allowed us to play windows games but at super low fps. Everything was going good until one day thieves came in stole all 6~10 iMacs from our classroom. It was shitty but it was also a shitty neighborhood (think Compton without any rap song about it). My grade 6 teacher was really crushed. We got another batch of iMacs and this time we had cables to hold down the iMacs in case someone tried to jack it again and they came in with cable cutters and made off with it AGAIN. Finally they created a dedicated iMac lab on the second floor classroom where thieves couldn&#x27;t break into. Quite a long thread stemming from BASIC lol.",

    "text": "The World Anti-Doping Agency constantly update their list of prohibited substances and develop new tests on a proactive basis. FG-4592 (and a number of similar compounds) have been on the prohibited list since the beginning of 2015. The list can be seen at the list below, and it is extremely comprehensive. Several other substances are not currently prohibited, but are monitored for their possible use as performance enhancing drugs. Alongside track and field athletes, cyclists are the most tested athletes in any sport, and are subject to three core testing regimes. Firstly, cyclists are subject to in-competition testing. The winner of any race (or the stage of a race) and a random sample of other riders will be subject to blood or urine tests. Secondly, the whereabouts program requires cyclists to notify the authorities of their location every day to facilitate out-of-competition testing. Athletes are randomly sampled, with extra scrutiny paid to the strongest performers. Thirdly, the biological passport scheme creates a long-term profile of a rider&#x27;s physiology, to track changes in markers like testosterone&#x2F;epitestosterone ratio and hematocrit that may indicate the use of performance enhancing drugs or methods. A sudden change in any of these markers or deviation outside normal ranges is grounds for sanctioning. In all tests, two samples are taken to safeguard against anomalous measurements or failures in the chain of custody. A portion of both samples is stored indefinitely, to facilitate retroactive testing if new drugs or methods are discovered. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wada-main-prod.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;files&#x2F;wada...",

Generally conductors have something called the &#x27;skin&#x27; effect, which is that as they conduct the electrons move along the outer surface. So the skysphere&#x27;s outer surface forms a ring where the current will move out to the edge, and then back to the center before going into the ground (or more literally coming from the ground but that is not important here). The change in current in the outer rings will create a magnetic pulse inside the ring that is proportional to the change in current, per Ampere&#x27;s law. And for conductors that are inside the sphere part, they will experience a very large change in magnetic flux, which will then induce an electric current in any conductors they have inside of them. It is entirely possible that every piece of electronic equipment inside the sphere will be destroyed by the resulting EMP. Or simply magnetized. But I&#x27;d really want to compute flux lines based on the lightning hitting the top, splitting down for four &#x27;rings&#x27; (Kirkoff&#x27;s law) and then going on down via the center into the earth.",

    "text": "I have a somewhat reverse problem. Some days I struggle to through the day coding, even on routine or easier coding tasks. When this happens find myself daydreaming or finding other things to do that are not work related. The real problem comes though at about 10-11pm and I get a huge burst of energy and focus to start working. I am left with a choice to stay up later and get work done, or go to bed and wake up earlier to catch up on work I missed. If I do decide to go to bed I will lay there for an hour or so just thinking about work and what I need to get done. With that said, last year I was talking to my doctor about it at my annual physical. He suggested I exercise more often. So for about the last 6-7 months I have made a conscious effort that whenever I feel like I am starting to struggle I will go out for at least a 30 minute walk. I usually end up taking about 4-5 a day. There is definitely a direct correlation between the amount I walk and my productivity. And I am starting to sleep a whole lot better at night. Another thing that has helped me is I stopped drinking soda and now only drink water (or coffee).",

The academic view seems that things weren&#x27;t that awful until 1931, when a large Austrian bank failed (Google Creditanstalt), which triggered a wave of global bank failures [1]. The resulting lack of credit was the cause that made the depression Great. When Creditanstalt went down, Dow was off ~50% from its 1929 high, which still happens every now and then. We went through a similar decline during the 2007-08 financial crisis and came out all right thanks to aggressive and globally organized central bank activity. Unfortunately such an organized response didn&#x27;t happen in the 1930s so the economies kept contracting, and the Dow eventually ended up losing 90%. Check out the charts in that period, it is fascinating. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fraser.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;meltzer&#x2F;bermac95.pdf",

First of all development of Ares has only recently been reinvigorated by LG devoting assets to the project which HP had taken a dump on when they pretty much gave up on WebOS.

Much work has been done by the LG designers as far as UI (I have followed their often ignored progress very closely of late) and the architecture of Enyo. It is commonly misunderstood due to media sensationalism that LG &quot;aquired&quot; WebOS and it&#x27;s goodies - NO NO NO - what they did is &quot;aquired&quot; the rights to utilize WebOS, along with the rights to own HP&#x27;s nifty little office building in San Francisco (to house LG&#x27;s nifty designers and devs) all under the agreement that they would pay an outrageous amount of money for these nifty items, and furthermore, that LG would slave away at WebOS&#x2F;Enyo so that HP doesn&#x27;t have to, all the while so that HP can benefit from the fruits since HP still owns WebOS&#x2F;Enyo and friends.

    "text": "&gt; Can we entirely rule out the possibility of AI researchers making advancements over time, and then eventually some research lab building one that&#x27;s super intelligent compared to us? Why? That&#x27;s not the thing we should be worried about, or at least that&#x27;s the point I got from the article. The thing we should be worried about is the way machine learning is applied in the here-and-now: the ethics of big data social networks, the robustness of complex (API-driven) systems, and so on. I fully agree that these issues are much more pressing and worrying than some emergent super-intelligence. But I thought the article was weak in its discussion of dreams, creativity, and linear &quot;flat data&quot;. It links to a June 2015 popular mechanics article about applying a genetic search optimization algorithm to discover gene regulatory networks, downplaying it as not-true-intelligence. But it does not mention deep neural networks and their higher-dimensional abstractions, particularly the psychedelic &quot;inception&quot; images. The author also mentions &quot;linear reasoning&quot;, and says he expects we&#x27;ll learn more about intelligence from stem cell and Alzheimer&#x27;s research, and the &quot;tissues surrounding neurons, and the roles they play in contextual regulation.&quot; As if to set up some dichotomy between machine and biological intelligence. But what about deep neural networks?? I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect the author&#x27;s arguments, but I&#x27;d like to see it discussed.",

    "text": "The standard example of unexpected esoteric physic application is the Special and General Relativity corrections of the GPS. 100 years ago nobody thought that we would ever use that small correction or that everybody would have a special-and-general-aware device in the pocket. Another cool application is the superconductors in the NMR devices. They can see what is inside your head and even do something equivalent to a chemical analysis (with NRM spectroscopy) without opening it. The first superconductors experiments used Helium at 4K, so they were only a laboratory curiosity. For everyday use, I like the giant magnetoresistance. This is my favorite case to explain that strange quantum effects have real world direct applications. Just start talking about the spin in electrons. Then explain that some magnetic conductors have a different value of the current with spin up and the currents with spin down. Then add the sandwich with non-magnetic conductors. At this moment it looks like a weird laboratory experiment. Then suddenly explain how it is used in hard disks heads: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giant_magnetoresistance",

    "text": "I&#x27;m confused as to why you would think about soldering a crimped connection Because most crimped connections (at least in the hobbyist&#x2F;DIY world) are crap . So after crimping, the only way they hold together is with solder. There are no applications where this is better. Every connector manufacturer I know recommends against doing it. You can get away with doing it if you support the soldered end against vibration, but you should do that anyway. It&#x27;s really a training issue. People haven&#x27;t been taught better and there is a lot of bad advice floating around hobbyist forums. I have only been using good crimping tools for the last few years since I started making a product with a 50-conductor harness. Until I spent $200 on a crimping tool and took the time to research how to make good crimps (Molex has an excellent document), I never realized how they were supposed to look. Now most of my tools are used, purchased at auctions of dead companies, but I have $400 crimping tools I paid pennies on the dollar for. Even so, I normally farm out crimping to a company that does it with automated machinery, better and faster than I can do by hand.",

I was lucky I that I came out with absolutely decent GCSEs (mostly As and Bs) but unlucky in that I felt shame and now defeat that I could have done much, much better. College was a write-off, I attempted 3 times but gave in after 3 months each time because the stress caused my inastentiveness in lessons made horrendously boring stoked psychosis which landed me in hospital each time. A lot of my life seems wasted having not known about ADHD-Pi (and of course my parents and educators), except for programming and computers which not only kept me in some degree sane (I could have been worse) but also led me into a job that seems matched to my traits and with a manager that is willing to overlook my big flaws because he thinks my skills with a computer far outweigh them.

    "text": "Great points and great blog too. Paradoxically I think what&#x27;s missing is more manned space exploration - people have a genuine interest in seeing other planets and knowing about space in general, but this interest is tempered by the painful awareness that that we will never get to visit them, so that it&#x27;s like being on an island with a tall tower and a great telescope (through which we can see enticing other places) but no way of building a boat. Of course going into space is so expensive and so few of us would make the cut as astronauts that hardly anyone realistically expects to become a space explorer, but we would like to live vicariously through other space explorers, but this isn&#x27;t possible if our explorers never go anywhere. I think the reason people get so wrapped up in the story of the Mars rovers and the Rosetta&#x2F;Philae mission was that those probes are the most relateable things since people walked on the Moon in the 1970s. Really, I think we should be doing manned Moon missions regularly. People point out that there&#x27;s nothing on the Moon that we want, which is sort of true (although we&#x27;ve learned so much since the last time we went that we should reconsider that angle) but that&#x27;s a dreadfully consumerist mindset. The Moon is a (relatively) accessible destination that we could use as a proving ground for interplanetary exploration techniques. But more importantly, making regular visits or having a permanent outpost there gives people something to project their imaginations onto (including their political and technological imagination). I have a small collection of old newspapers and my favorite is one published the day after the first Moon landing with the simple headline &#x27;Men on Moon&#x27;. Reading it still gives me a shiver of excitement, followed by disappointment that we abandoned Moon exploration by the mid 1970s. One often-forgotten detail of the Moon landing was that at the time there was a Russian observer spacecraft orbiting the Moon, and it dropped down to within 10 miles of the surface at the time of the landing (presumably to observe what the Americans were up to). I saw Neil DeGrasse Tyson on Charlie Rose last week and he was joking that his favorite daydream is meeting the Chinese President at a conference and persuading him to leak a fake memo saying China aims to land a man on Mars, which would galvanize the American body politic back into serious investment in space. Sad but true.",

    "text": "Oh goodie, I love these questions. I&#x27;m going to assume the following is true about you: 1. You can translate someone&#x27;s desires for a product into a software spec. 2. You can translate a spec into a real, working piece of software by programming it using your favorite languages and tech stack. 3. You can do the above in a reasonable amount of time, reliably and consistently, and follow a project deadline with milestones without too much supervision. 4. Your friend is asking for this because he wants to market it as part of a product or service. Great! If you want to be fair to him and give him &quot;mate&#x27;s rates&quot; then charge him $2000 per week. Why $2000 per week? Here is the logical progression: 1. You have the aforementioned, assumed skills (which I am deducing from you being a developer of 3 - 4 years) that make you very valuable. 2. Your floor for making an iOS app for a client would be $5000 per week. Why? Because it&#x27;s mostly arbitrary and it&#x27;s what the market would pay, and I assure you the market would bear someone of your skills being paid this much money. 3. $2000 per week is a vastly discounted rate from the $5000 figure quoted above, which is appropriate for friends. Note that this is appropriate for friends working together as business partners, not for something so insignificant that a friend is doing it pro bono. That you want to be paid at all indicates this situation is not the latter. When I do technical consulting I always bill weekly. I fundamentally disagree with billing hourly for a variety of reasons, so I think you&#x27;re right that you should not be billing hourly. If you don&#x27;t want to bill weekly you can set an entire project fee. In that case, I would take the above amount and multiply it by the number of weeks you anticipate working. What I would emphasize to you is that pricing is basically arbitrary. You simply charge the highest amount the market will bear. If this project is worth doing and &quot;serious&quot; enough to warrant you being paid, you might as well be paid generously, even if it is very discounted for a friend.",

I&#x27;m used to it, honestly, because it&#x27;s become obvious over time that holding an opinion in contrast to what HN wants to hear is a nearly guaranteed ticket to comment illegibility. HN is the only forum on which I participate where disagreement is acceptably expressed as making someone&#x27;s thoughts more difficult to read. I&#x27;m merely presenting my (long earned) observations on Reddit. I absolutely think it&#x27;s a shitshow, a terrible place full of terrible people, but I suspect I&#x27;m being punished for daring to suggest that there is something wrong with the site itself. In the smaller subreddits, there are absolutely small embers of really powerfully rewarding conversation. There is stuff worth saving on Reddit, and I think the loud stuff drowns it out. I&#x27;ve had extremely fulfilling conversations about network security, application security, game modification, and polyamory in the various communities of which I am a part, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot. My experience isn&#x27;t representative because I subscribe to nearly zero default subs. To your point, I think SRS serves as the complete counterexample to everything you&#x27;re saying. The entire purpose of SRS is to brigade and single out individual Redditors, and I&#x27;ve seen the results firsthand. If FPH was doing it, there isn&#x27;t a universe in existence where SRS gets off that hook and it makes sense. Transparency is important here, as you say.",

    "text": "My point, and perhaps I was unclear, is that people seem happy to exchange the costs of density for the benefits of density (trains and airports; lots of varied good provided; many different kinds of jobs from many different employers; etc), ie, that there are no &quot;density issues&quot; with cities, it&#x27;s just that people really want to live on top of each other as much as the rapidly rising costs seem to indicate, and we haven&#x27;t adjusted to this idea as a society yet from our older vision of sparse open West and the American frontier (or pick your local myths). The post I was replying to implied that people were somehow forced in to cities -- it&#x27;s just untrue. They could be lots of other places, they just choose to be in cities. (Nothing in my post was about how cities nucleated, and was entirely about why cities have the rising costs they do, which reflect a HUGE demand for more city rather than a demand for out of the city.) I didn&#x27;t mean that if you found a unicorn, they wouldn&#x27;t prefer it, just that at the end of day, people made the compromise of plowing their fields with horses, not narwhals. Focusing on the horn as &quot;man, that would be a great feature to add!&quot; misses something interesting in why they picked the horse to the (perhaps arguably) more majestic narwhal. I would even argue that studying why the preference when you split the unicorn in to extant beings is the paramount question about the topic, since it gives us the seeds to move forward building more dense (and enjoyable!) cities and societies. I find it interesting that despite everyone lamenting how they wish they weren&#x27;t in cities, they don&#x27;t take any of the many opportunities to move to smaller cities or out of cities all together, despite there being many such chances. (Some people do, obviously, and are quite happy with their choice. I just meant that there was a net flow in to cities.) In so far as you point out that cities seem to top out a certain size that doesn&#x27;t hit any inherent physical constraints, our daydreaming about unicorns (and more importantly, our discussion of horse versus narwhal) serves to improve these limits and let us move towards more focused centers of human activity. The information age (and really... modern humans for ~10,000 years) has been driven largely by focused human intelligence, of which cities -- being a natural focal point of human efforts -- have played center stage. The story of humanity since the ice age can be glibly phrased as: we found a way to stay in one place, and grew; we found a way to get power more efficiently, and got denser, and grew; we made many theoretical breakthroughs about the mechanics of getting, storing, transporting, and using power, and got denser, and grew. The past few centuries have been a concerted effort on externalizing our various faculties, following a series of breakthroughs on fundamentals, and as a result we&#x27;ve been able to double the population in just the past ~100 years. People have picked up on the narrative, even if they don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s happening, yet. They enjoy getting to be part of the important cluster of human activity, instead of relegated to energy production out on a farm. tl;dr: You made an uncharitable reading of my posts, and failed to connect that I was using &quot;enjoy&quot; as a euphemism for the idea of a &quot;utility&quot; function, because I was talking in public, and wanted my idea to be generally understood rather than technically sound. This error in parsing my post led you to make a long rant -- concurring with me. Your violent agreement amused me, so I wrote you a rant back. [Ed: Or just flat out missed I was talking about why the skyrocketing prices, not the nucleation of new cities.] Hope you&#x27;re having a good day. (:",

On the other side I removed all the JSON things and the Pub&#x2F;Sub (IMHO is interesting to subscribe to areas to see objects entering&#x2F;exiting them, not much to position updates since it&#x27;s the same of doing PUBLISH+GEOADD from the client side). Added: GEOHASH to return a Geohash standard string from of a given element, mainly for interoperability. I&#x27;m also adding GEODIST (to calculate distances) and GEOPOS (to retrieve latitude&#x2F;longitude of objects without the need to query for radius). The work will be available in the context of Redis 3.2, unless I get mad and merge back into 3.0, which is unlikely but not impossible. EDIT: before of three days ago I was not aware of Geohashing at all, so if you have five mins to check the code, I&#x27;ll be glad :-) Thanks. I&#x27;m pretty confident that it&#x27;s ok now after I added a fuzzy test that replicates the feature (by brute forcing distance computation) in Tcl that checks against the Redis output, but still...

Her brother, Cherokee was an NBA player at the time and from my place in the pit, Corey Parks looked about seven feet tall. The combination of the very tall and imposing Corey Parks playing bass on one side, combined with Ruyter Sighs playing guitar on the other was very powerful. Nashville Pussy&#x27;s lead singer and drummer were both men, but Ruyter Sighs&#x27; flat out amazing guitar playing really drove the sound. Are they a girl band or a male band? Or, what about Sonic Youth? Are they are a girl band or a male band? Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore decided they wanted to start making music, so they recruited Lee Ranaldo and eventually found a drummer. Kim Gordon was just as much a creative force as any of the men she played with and when she finally put her bass down, lo and behold, she was a damned good guitar player. Or, how about Bikini Kill? Are they a girl band or a male band? They&#x27;re most heavily associated with riot grrl and are mostly considered Kathleen Hanna&#x27;s band, but Billy Karren was a straight up incredible guitar player.

One helpful data point could be whether the library supports a (formal) custom build apparatus, since you can often get a sizable reduction that way. Full jQuery UI clocks in at ~242K, but using http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jqueryui.com&#x2F;download&#x2F; you can often strip it down to 20K or less. Similarly with THREE.js and several others. Going in the other direction, a library that seems small (Backbone.js, @ ~20K) may actually end up being relatively heavy because of required external dependencies. A more explicit side-by-side &quot;compare&quot; function would also be nice here, comparing library size along with other metrics like script loader compatibility, maintenance frequency, different flavors of popularity, etc.",

It&#x27;s also true that when you directly contradict someone else&#x27;s perspective, you can expect push-back from them. The reaction of dang and others here is ample evidence of that. Getting in shouting matches makes your argument much, much less effective, not to mention making the forum for those shouting matches an unpleasant place to be. Instead of saying &quot;No, you stupid douchebag&quot;, why not phrase your argument in terms of &quot;Yes, and...&quot;? Instead of posting screeds about how early employees of startups get screwed, why not phrase it as &quot;Startup founders could solve many of their hiring problems by offering meaningful equity - not just a few percent, but enough that a successful exit is life-changing for all their early employees. This would also fix incentive alignment problems and ensure that employees keep working hard even when they&#x27;re not in the same room as the boss.&quot; You might find some unlikely allies, even among the likes of Sam Altman [1] or Andrew Mason [2]. Or instead of complaining about how Evan Spiegel is an undeserving twat who represents everything wrong with the VC industry, why not highlight the startups whose products you believe are deserving, evangelize them to friends and acquaintances, intro them to people who may help them, and help ensure that the next founder who ends up with a unicorn deserves it? As you&#x27;ve said before, negative information never gets erased, you have to &quot;flood the channel&quot; [3]. The connection that you didn&#x27;t make is that negative information (and its ensuing push-back) also reflects negatively on the person who posted it, since most readers are intelligent and can assume that there&#x27;s more to the story than the side that was posted.

    "text": "I think it&#x27;s easier to explain this in terms of likelihood theory. Likelihood is the probability of observed data GIVEN A SPECIFIC MODEL. This is NOT to be confused with the probability of a specific model being correct GIVEN THE OBSERVED DATA. It is the later probability that people want to really know, but confusing it with the former probability can have catastrophic consequences in fields like medicine, engineering, jurisprudence, finance and insurance. The problem is related to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Fallacy ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prosecutor%27s_fallacy ): &quot;Consider this case: a lottery winner is accused of cheating, based on the improbability of winning. At the trial, the prosecutor calculates the (very small) probability of winning the lottery without cheating and argues that this is the chance of innocence. The logical flaw is that the prosecutor has failed to account for the large number of people who play the lottery.&quot; There is a mathematical statistics professor at the University of Toronto named D.A.S. Fraser ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utstat.utoronto.ca&#x2F;dfraser&#x2F; ) who is an expert in likelihood theory and has commented on this issue: &quot;...statistics does have the answer! The answer is contained in the p-value function from likelihood theory: p(delta) Here delta is the relevant parameter with delta_0 as the null value and delta_1 as the alternative needing detection. Then p(delta_0) is the observed p-value, p(delta_1) is the detection probability, and the rest is judgement: the route to the Higgs boson.&quot;",

We currently do have one data center, but this design allows us to bring others online. If the datacenter was hit by a meteor all our customers would get an email blast urging them to create a local backup immediately. The chances that both the DC and the user would get hit by the same natural disaster are relatively small. Still, it&#x27;s not a storage service like S3 so geo-redundancy plays a smaller role. We do plan on building out other datacenters in the future, but since we&#x27;re bootstrapped, we have to do that when the time is right, otherwise it would be very easy to over-extend ourselves and start losing money. edit -&gt; I ignored your Backblaze dev question, sorry.

Many open source projects do something like this, a dual license where the source code for the project is GPL, but the creator is willing to license it for something as non-gpl to people unwilling to release their source code. This requirement set by unreal is very very analogous. They just have some shifted priorities, however for me this project now meets the standard of what I would consider &quot;ethical&quot;. Could it be better? Sure why not? It could be GPL dual license, people who want to benefit from open source but release closed source I think should have to pay, that would be better. However, this library can now be effectively used for open source initiatives. This is fantastic. That&#x27;s my estimation of the situation anyway, you perhaps do not see it like this.

Unreal Engine is also moving quite quickly, adding new features, marketplace content, improving the UI, etc.",

    "text": "It&#x27;s hard to compare unity and unreal. To answer the question about c++, with UE4, the blueprint system removes almost all of that. Entire games can be written in their visual programming language. I also think there are ways to use c# ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mono-ue.github.io&#x2F; ), if you prefer that as well. C++ is needed if you want to extend the native classes. Regarding the editor, unreal is pretty amazing. It really shines in the tools department. Check out the landscape editor, materials editor, and animation tools on youtube. Pretty fantastic stuff. The game engine itself is better than unity in almost every way with a few big exceptions: 1) multiplayer map size. unity can pretty easily support large online worlds 2) support for mobile&#x2F;tablets. unity is the dominant platform on those devices. 3) community support. unity has a much larger community, better documentation, and a much more populous online store (though unreal is catching up)",

    "text": "Can you even compare them :) Evaluation of software, be it library, framework, sdk or a whole engine+tools is much much harder than writing actual software, especially when royalties, copyright and other legal issues are involved. In reality there is no way of knowing what would do your best, so you can look at specific bad parts and take that into decision making, for example, for what I&#x27;ve heard (and possibly it could be wrong): - Unity is not really good when lots of people have to edit the same files, merging is not really good, and the server option does not really cut it. (For example Quake&#x27;s engine .map text files are not so bad to merge in cvs&#x2F;svn&#x2F;p4&#x2F;etc.) - Unreal had always had the bad &quot;fame&quot; of 30-only fps game, while this is okay for certain shooters, or 3rd person games, it would&#x27;ve never worked for &quot;Call of Duty&quot; where the brand was simply established with 60fps. To some people this might sound a bit pedantic, but 60fps matters! (And &gt;60fps does not really, unless you need to swap frames for a 3D VR device of sort) That to be said both engines surely have really good parts. From little I&#x27;ve explored in Unity, what got me first was the ability to extend the editor while it&#x27;s running - I could add menus with functionality while it was running - this is super cool. Unreal on the other side is well known engine with lots of people from the AAA game industry familiar with it, and while the editor might seem completely foreign to people starting in the game industry, it&#x27;s pretty well known by many others (I guess they don&#x27;t advertise it much). The hidden gem of Unreal for me, was it&#x27;s internal UI system, which could be used as a separate project - it has docking, controls, etc. - it might be a good replacement for Qt, MFC, wxWidgets, etc.",

I had ruled out Unreal and kinda settled on using Unity for my tinkering with games, because of the pricing differences...but now that Unity is so much more expensive at $1500+$1500 for each platform you want to support (if you don&#x27;t want a Unity splash screen and the limits of the free version), and Unreal being effectively free forever for me (since I sincerely doubt any of my tinkering will result in a game that makes $3000+ a quarter, ever), I&#x27;m leaning toward giving Unreal more of my attention. But, I primarily want to develop for mobile, so having an effective mobile deployment process with the engine is kinda mandatory.",

(1) Availability (Something fails eventually), both in terms of monitoring (Find out) and failover (How to resolve when this happens?) (2) Security (Who had access to which key when? Are they still at the company? Where&#x27;s the audit trail? Third-party managed security credentials ... can you say side-channel?) (3) Legal jurisdiction (Are we allowed to put x in y location? Do we want government x using law y to potentially perform action z ?) (4) Latency (Site x on provider y is experiencing a DDoS) (5) Heterogeneous management (What happens if something auto-managed gets manually-managed for awhile? Do things break?) (6) Resource lead time and failure impact (What happens when the hardware you just wanted to spin up from the endless cloud supply isn&#x27;t available?) (7) Actual performance characteristics (Usually every provider offers only a specific selection of environments and offers weak to no SLAs&#x2F;guarantees on real world performance.) ... and so on. A lot of these are sort of cloud restatements of the RFC1925[1] fundamental truths of networking. Also, this is all docker-specific, so it hinges on people wanting to build their infrastructure on a self-described insecure and immature platform and tie their whole management paradigm to it. FWIW, I am still working on an OS and virtualization platform agnostic alternative devops process management tool[2] and am trying to get my company to agree to open source it. It can easily wrap docker, having far broader scope, and was designed to be future-proofed... it is thus potentially useful for embedded dev, the BSDs, real hardware, clusters, etc. It takes a very different paradigm to docker, abstracting cloud providers, services and platforms separately, and allowing the former to figure out how to connect and manage the other two internally... with standardized interfaces for major operations and notifications.

Back in the early days of computers, many of them like the C64 or TRS80 (circa 1985-ish) had an option to use a TV as a monitor to save money. I recall that I had a Trash 80 and it was hooked up to the TV with a cable splitter in a spare bedroom. There were a number of relatives and friends visiting and myself someone that shared my love of computing were in the there programming away, and really programming, we are talking assembler here. And after a couple of hours we came down to the living room and everyone had the TV on channel 3 and everyone was watching us (I did not realize the splitter was broadcasting throughout the cable in our house). I guess there was nothing better on back them before cable had 100&#x27;s of channels. It was interesting to hear the non-programmers questions and comments about what we were doing and really how much they had actually picked up on.",

I forget exactly what it was but it was something like &quot;Java Python Flash Linux game developer&quot; or whatever. I had learned about this from an out-of-the-blue client lead who emailed me. I was shocked when he said that&#x27;s how he found me. I then went around to about a dozen different computers, different types, different geo locations in my state, both auth&#x27;ed and anonymous, and sure enough I always came up as top result, first page. It was... an awesome time to be taking on contract&#x2F;consulting work, let me tell you. So many more leads coming in than before. Not enough hours in the week&#x2F;month to help them, had to turn down otherwise interesting gigs. Then it came to an end. Rug pulled out. Woke up one day, rankings changed, no longer on top like that. Lesson (one anyway): that&#x27;s a huge eyeball funnel. bazillions of people doing searches. even getting a tiny slice of it means tons of eyeballs stumbling upon you. quality is important, of course, being great at what you do, having the right leads, a good fit, avail, etc. But quantity?

    "text": "If Rosetta had an operations crew nearby - even just one person - the cost of the mission would have been, what, 100x greater? Surely enough more expensive to pay for multiple robotic probes. Total mission cost for Rosetta = 1.4 billion Euros. It costs something like $50,000&#x2F;kg for GEO, so I&#x27;ll use that as the baseline. The Orion capsule weighs 21 tons and the Deep Space Habitat at least 50 tons. Add one person and the 5 kg of consumables per day, for a mission of 300 days, gives another 2 tons. That&#x27;s $3 billion already, or 2.4 billion Euros. Now add the development costs, support staff, communications, etc. and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to send a small fleet of redundant probes than to send a single human. To double check, an Orion capture of an asteroid in an orbit close to Earth&#x27;s is $2.6 billion (see http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orion_%28spacecraft%29#Explorat... ), again, excluding development costs. In any case, we have no way to put a human on the same orbit as a comet, much less return the human safely to Earth, so only a robot mission is possible.",

    "text": "I prefer well known memory lifetimes, but I&#x27;m undecided about ARC (or somewhat equivalently: std::shared_ptr, etc.). It can be a little confusing and overwrought at times, and I don&#x27;t think the lifetimes are as clear as they could be. IMO, more languages shouldn&#x27;t assume that there is a single memory allocator. That&#x27;s one of the worst assumptions I see in systems languages -- even C++ (before C++11) got this entirely wrong. Swift gets this wrong, Go gets this wrong. Rust is probably a little better because it actually has a static idea of memory scope, but I haven&#x27;t seen a way to swap out the memory allocator in various contexts. Most projects I&#x27;ve been involved with have used region&#x2F;arena allocators. Not only do you mostly avoid the non-determism of your average GC, but you avoid the hassle of fine grained reference counting (in most cases). This relies on you choosing the scopes for your regions appropriately, but there usually is a clear scope to attach things to (e.g. frames, iteration of an event loop, etc.).",

    "text": "(I&#x27;m the author&#x2F;founder.) Old one did distributed breadth-first graph exploration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zerotier&#x2F;ZeroTierOne&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OLD-Multicast-A... It was nifty and cool and worked pretty well for small to mid tier stuff, but biggest disadvantages in practice were: (1) Peers seem to drop the potato more often than I predicted when I simulated it, leading to a lot of truncated propagations. It also has no geo-awareness, so if your propagation graph goes through sub-Saharan Africa you&#x27;re likely to see a lot of packet loss. I think my simulations implicitly assumed all high-end first-world broadband links, when reality includes the whole world and a lot of slow&#x2F;crummy cellular. (2) High latency, which caused problems for people who wanted low-latency multicast for SDN-type applications (enterprise stuff). In the beginning I never considered those applications, but they&#x27;re emerging as a major user base. (3) Imposed a high CPU cost, since to prevent flooding every packet had to be cryptographically signed by its originating node. That&#x27;s a lot of ECC256 signatures and verifications. (4) Mobile-unfriendly, since mobile devices really want to be able to enter long-term hibernation and not have to wake to help others propagate their multicasts. Mobile might even want to turn off most multicast, only allowing ARP and NDP or even emulating these for no multicast at all. (Currently working on iOS and Android ZT1 ports.) This also applies to tiny low power embedded devices, and I&#x27;ve had some interest from Internet-of-things experimenters. There&#x27;s no write-up on the new algorithm yet, but it&#x27;s basically sender-side replication with lazy but deterministic gathering. It gathers recipients up to the limit from supernodes and from peers. (In reality supernodes are peers-- they&#x27;re merely peers designated as such.) I remember initially passing on that idea since I was afraid it would be too heavy on the sender, but observing real traffic flows shows that in aggregate the multicast traffic load ends up close to the same. Sender-side replication is also inherently fair -- sender pays the price -- so you don&#x27;t need such heavy signature&#x2F;verification checks to ensure that somebody can&#x27;t flood the network. This way it&#x27;s no easier to flood with multicast than with unicast. (Obviously anyone can DDOS but that&#x27;s another matter.) In the longer term I plan to add some support for merging of multicasts going to the same local network or site, but I&#x27;m not sure how yet... it&#x27;s probably going to intersect with R&amp;D work I&#x27;m doing right now on enterprise supernode federation for SDN applications and similar stuff.",

Then you get into the exciting world of bytecode manipulation, which is necessary for some mocking libraries. And, most annoyingly, it&#x27;s basically impossible to mock static methods. I&#x27;ve worked in projects that used extensive Java mocking and on a project that used Go with hand-rolled mocks. I experienced far less pain with Go, because everything was plain and simple.

    "text": "Hi MichaelGG, I am a Program Manager for Azure Search and as curiousDog mentioned, yes along with DocumentDB, we also announced Azure Search which is a PaaS based full text search service. We actually leverage ElasticSearch at the core of this service and as chippy says about spatial search, we do have the ability to provide a pretty solid geo-spatial search capability thanks to Elastic Search and Lucene. To nemothekids&#x27;s point, is it very unlikely that we will offer this as a local (non-hosted) version because we found that although ElasticSearch is awesome, one of the common complaints many admin&#x27;s have is the complexity around managing systems such as ElasticSearch&#x2F;SOLR&#x2F;Lucene at high scale and how difficult it is to implement more advanced search capabilities such as tuning and relevancy. Those are areas we think we can add a lot of value being a fully managed service. Longer term, we think this will also allow us to bring even more value on top of search by adding in other Microsoft technologies. For example, we could tie in Bing Maps to allow you to easily tie in reverse geo-coding right into your search. Or perhaps allow you to leverage Bing&#x27;s synonym list so that you could allow people to search yet find results that are synonyms to commonly searched words (i.e., user types in shoes, but in your content it is referred to as footwear). Multi-language support is actually one of the big things we want to tackle in the short term and we believe that the NLP from Office will really help jump start us with this. Liam",

    "text": "It depends on how you plan your future. I&#x27;ve used quite a few text editors over the years (Bluefish, Scite, Homesite, Phase5, Idle, TextMate, Vim, others). I switched to Emacs more than a year ago with one clear goal: Not having to switch anymore. You see, most of the editors above (except vim) used to be good and then were deprecated, sold, stopped, and so on. Which of those has been existing for more than 20 years and is still able to hold up to new editors. Sadly, none (One could argue for TextMate 2, but in between there were many, many years of staleness). I was fed up with having to switch to a newfangled editor every so many years, having to identify new plugins, having to learn new keybindings. I&#x27;ve used Vim for 7 years (I think) and it came pretty close, but in the end the archaic VimScript language and the lack of async commands was something that was nagging me. I wanted to call an editor home, and hone my skills until I pass away, increasing my arcane knowledge over 10-20 years, learning ever more about the scripting language, commands, and writing more and more specific plugins that help with my tasks. I still want to be coding in 10 years, but I don&#x27;t want to switch text editors ever again. Emacs shall be my final editor [1], and that&#x27;s why I decided to switch. Because I can see Emacs still going strong in another 20 years. I wouldn&#x27;t want to say that about Sublime, or really any other editor right now. [1] There&#x27;s a case to be made that NeoVim is going to be great, and it may well be, but right now I&#x27;m really, really, really happy with Emacs + Evil. Nothing is perfect, of course, but the things that bug me are really, really small things that I could probably even fix, if I&#x27;d invest enough time; but they don&#x27;t bug me enough for that.",

We sometimes watch your scotch friday meetings, and Jack comes to our neck of the woods for a &quot;scotch tuesday&#x2F;wednesday&quot; every so often. In more relevant news, the CEO (Jonathan Bush) just wrote a book (&quot;wrote&quot;, he joked) that&#x27;s a semi-right-wing take on the problem posed in this article (lack of EHR interoperability). Solid read though regardless of politics. Also, the MDP program (the API you&#x27;re referring to) is more designed to allow third party developers to build functionality onto athenanet that we don&#x27;t have the specialization or capacity to build. It&#x27;s not really a means of sharing health data (to my knowledge). However! We have been making the sharing of EHR data a priority, or at least seeming to, with the formation of the CommonWell Health Alliance (members including most major EHR creators... except Epic, because they&#x27;re Epic). Additionally, we&#x27;re working on some stuff with athenaCommunicator to help hospitals talk to labs, and stuff with Coordinator that I think involves the Austin crew too... but I don&#x27;t know what of Coordinator we&#x27;re allowed to talk about yet so I&#x27;ll probably shut up on that matter.",

Just make sure you aren&#x27;t tying any identity you care about to dangerous transactions. That&#x27;s the only (and of course difficult) trick. If a drug buyer in a BTC transaction got the coins anonymously (say, sent a self-destructing robot to drop off cash in exchange for BTC), then that part is fine. They can go use those coins anonymously. If they ship drugs to their house, well... that alone sort of undoes it all. The drug sellers that were caught from Silk Road were caught due to things like making a huge amount of trips to post offices, getting the attention of postal workers. That may be a parallel construction, but it seems legitimate enough. Buy drugs from large seller, look at the postmarks for patterns. Then go gumshoeing around and wait &#x27;til you see the same car or people going to the same post offices over and over and over.

Additionally, it seems the site does show up in Google search results on the 10th page ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;encrypted.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=photo%20quilts#h... ). I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t understand what exactly that means, but it seems to have happened at around the same timeframe that you&#x27;re referring to (5 or 6 months ago), so I&#x27;m going to bet it&#x27;s a factor. Hope you figure it out - the whole search engine algorithm thing is really complex. But, honestly, I don&#x27;t believe that Google just stopped working for a single domain. The more likely scenario is that something you&#x2F;your sister is unaware of changed and had a large negative result.",

If you check the backlinks using any number of checkers (Open Site Explorer, Ahrefs, Majestic SEO) you can find a number of over-optimized &#x27;unnatural&#x27; backlinks residing on spammy link-exchange pages in clear violation of Google&#x27;s guidelines. The only reason to place links on these pages would be to try to rise higher in Google&#x27;s search results. Yes, it feels unfair when Google drops you in search results, and Google has changed the rules over the years and it&#x27;s hard to keep up with shifting guidelines. In truth, the website can recover from this. The same people who placed spammy links on 3rd party sites in order to manipulate rankings are probably savvy enough to mount a clean up effort to get those links removed and&#x2F;or file a disavow request with Google (which basically tells them to ignore those links) Ironically, Eric Schmidt once tried to scrub Google of unfavorable search results about himself, and he was told they do not do that for individual results. ;)",

Looks to me like it was hit by Google&#x27;s Penguin 2.0 update [1] that targeted sites that had low quality links pointing in to their domain (in particular inner pages). Probably not the sisters fault, but the site has done a lot of reciprocal linking in the past which Google really frowns upon nowadays. There&#x27;s prominent page on her site featuring some of those links: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.portraitquilts.com&#x2F;info&#x2F;links She also has some links from pages that are selling or exchange links to spam&#x2F;escort sites: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwr.com&#x2F;gifts&#x2F;crafts.html http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livebusinessradio.com&#x2F;trade&#x2F;recip.cgi Again, probably not her fault.

If you are going to try to figure out which links caused a problem, you&#x27;ll want to use ahrefs and majesticseo to compile a list of your backlinks, then either start sorting through them manually or use something like LinkResearchTools as a starting point. Keep in mind that removing links will probably not return your previous rankings, since the links that once caused you to rank well may now be the ones causing the problem. Removing them may restore your ability to rank well again. Also, not every ranking drop means that you were penalized. If you know you had built lots of spammy links, and your traffic dropped off at the same time Penguin was updated, then it is more likely a Penguin problem. Otherwise, there are hundreds of reasons that would need to be examined. If you are not sure, consider hiring a reputable SEO consultant to help. It won&#x27;t be cheap. Cheap is probably what got you in trouble in the first place.",

I&#x27;ll stipulate up front that I&#x27;ve never worked as a government employee, and despite doing some assessment work (like being hired to break into the Department of the Interior without their knowledge, or breaking hardware&#x2F;software that was being deployed in far away places) everywhere I&#x27;ve worked has tried very hard to steer clear of government work (not for any ethical reasons, it just pays much worse than equivalent commercial work, and is almost always boring). In fact, the last two places I worked had distinct government and commercial divisions (where I ran the commercial divisions). That said, I&#x27;ve built and run several security consulting practices in the DC area, and consequently have done hiring interviews for dozens of people who were NSA employees (1 of which we ended up hiring). Absolutely none of them have even the slightest apprehension about the nature of the work they were doing (so much as they were able to comment about it during interviews). In fact, prior to the Snowden leaks, the NSA was pretty much at the bottom of my list for government agencies doing shit I disliked. They have a pretty clear scope and charter (which we&#x27;ve come to learn has been muddied). But no one I&#x27;ve talked to, either who works there or works at a contractor in the DIB, thinks they&#x27;ve done anything wrong. Did you read those batshit NSA talking points that came out yesterday from Al Jazeera&#x27;s FOIA request? They believe those things. They think they&#x27;re doing important, valuable work to protect the country. I can only imagine that internally within NSA there has been dissent about some of the stuff that&#x27;s come out. Maybe people have resigned over it, maybe they&#x27;ve sent strongly-worded emails to their bosses. I really hope there was a great deal of dissent about the &quot;intentionally fuck up crypto standards that we push to other branches of the government&quot;, but I doubt we&#x27;ll ever hear much about it. Your questions could just as easily refer to people who work on SEO spam, or targeted advertisements (I&#x27;m not saying those things are equivalent, but they&#x27;re also jobs I&#x27;ve heard people on here posturing morally about).",

    "text": "Ok, this guy is using a couple of methods off BlackHatWorld (Probably the biggest SEO forum around if you haven&#x27;t heard of it) So essentially this guy is building this site, ranking it in Google using the churn &#x27;n Burn method, then once its ranking well he&#x27;ll contact local business saying he can link to them in return for a fee. Even though the domain is 6 months old, if you look at ahrefs this guy has 33k backlinks to the homepage. Google had a major SEO update on October 4th which essentially fucked up their algorithm more than it already was. This churn &#x27;n burn method means that you spam out a zillion backlinks and you will rank really well until the next Google update comes along (which is around 3-4 months) You could do this in the previous Google update (Penguin 2.1) and I thought Google would fix this but they just made it easier. This is a good example of the method: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackhatworld.com&#x2F;blackhat-seo&#x2F;black-hat-seo&#x2F;5769... (This was the one of the guys that essentially figured out this method from what I can tell) So with this new Google update, they are getting rid of some of the spammy sites, but more spam sites just taken their places in the rankings. Now they are focusing on the amount of content on your site rather than the backlinks. So now 10 year old sites with hundreds of legitimate, high authority backlinks are getting outranked but spammy sites with 14 backlinks and 300 gibberish articles. I&#x27;ve also been reading that with local Google searches, you get results from completely different countries. For example, people in the UK were reporting that they were getting results from sites in Russia, Argentina and New Zealand instead of UK results. I don&#x27;t think this happens as much in America from what I know. So I&#x27;m guessing Google is eventually going to iron out these problems, but it&#x27;s a battleground at the moment. If you do get outranked by this guy, make a video with your keywords in the title, same with a Facebook and LinkedIn page and then buy a bunch of backlinks off Fiverr. They should outrank pretty much any other website in a matter of days.",

    "text": "Hey all, this is the author of Ginkgo &amp; Gomega. I&#x27;m excited to see all this thoughtful conversation and figured I&#x27;d chime in with a response to keep the conversation going. (Apologies for the long post!) - Godoc documentation is coming soon. Godoc is great for API-style documentation but not particularly appropriate for tutorial&#x2F;structured&#x2F;narrative-style documentation. Think golang.org&#x2F;pkg vs golang.org&#x2F;doc. I wanted to write the &#x2F;doc first as I believe it to be more valuable for beginners and is often overlooked by the go community. &#x2F;pkg is coming soon (a few days) and is much easier to write. - @buro9: Golang is BDD-style in the same way that Cedar and Jasmine are BDD-style. This is not Cucumber (way too much DSL for me!) With that said, asynchronous testing support is baked right into Ginkgo and Gomega so the API-testing that you&#x27;d like would be easily expressed in Ginkgo and Gomega. - Assertions that I have fundamentally misunderstood Golang or the distinction between dynamic and static typed languages are interesting and I&#x27;d like to address some of them. BDD-style testing need not be limited to dynamically-typed language. Yes dynamically-typed languages need far more comprehensive test coverage to make up for the missing compiler. That&#x27;s why I tend to prefer statically-typed languages. To me BDD-style (vs the XUnit style) isn&#x27;t primarily about addressing these deficiencies in dynamic languages -- it&#x27;s about expressiveness . To that end, I think that BDD and Golang go hand in hand. Let me explain. BDD is exceptionally good at describing the behavior of branching code. Golang is filled with branching code that needs to be described in test. Here&#x27;s a classic example in pseudo-go: func DoSomethingAwesome(dependencyA DepA, dependencyB DepB) awesome Awesome, err error { stuffA, err := dependencyA.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } stuffB, err := dependencyB.Gimme() if err != nil { return Awesome{}, err } .... return awesome, nil } With Ginkgo you can cover these branches expressively: Describe(&quot;Doing something Awesome&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;common happy case setup Context(&quot;When all is well&quot;, func() { It(&quot;should be awesome&quot;, ...) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyA fails&quot;, func() { BeforeEach(...) &#x2F;&#x2F;set dependencA up for failure It(&quot;should return a zero Awesome&quot;, func() { ... Expect(awesome).To(BeZero()) }) It(&quot;should error&quot;, func() { ... Expect(err).To(HaveOccured()) }) }) Context(&quot;When dependencyB fails&quot;, func() { &#x2F;&#x2F;etc... }) }) Compare this to the XUnit style: func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenAllIsWell() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyAFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } func TestDoingSomethingAwesomeWhenDependencyBFails() { &#x2F;&#x2F;setup + tweak &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion that awesome is zero &#x2F;&#x2F;some sort of assertion about err } I prefer the former (note: that&#x27;s a subjective statement). IMO there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally more Golangish about the latter (if anything the fact that func&#x27;s that begin with Test are special is kinda weird), and since Gomega&#x27;s matchers are fluent in Go they know about things like zero values and errors having occured. Moreover, both Ginkgo and Gomega have been built to make testing asynchronous code (read: concurrent goroutines) easy and expressive. This isn&#x27;t a carbon copy of RSpec&#x2F;Cedar&#x2F;Jasmine, it&#x27;s a synthesis of the best ideas from those testing frameworks expressed in ways that cater specifically to Golang. - Concerns about using interface{} and reflection seem odd to me. First off, the Go authors provide both of these things to precisely solve the sort of problem that Gomega is trying to solve. Nobody wants to write and maintain matchers that look like: Expect(foo).To(EqualInt64(3)) Expect(bar).To(EqualString(&quot;blarp&quot;)) Expect(baz).To(EqualMyCustomAwesomeType(awesome)) besides the reflect package&#x27;s `DeepEqual` does a great job comparing `interface{}` to `interface{}` correctly. Most importantly of all: we&#x27;re all using interface{} all the time: `fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d %f %s %v&quot;, ...)`! And thanks for seeing the point @karma_fountain: Gomega&#x27;s matchers have excellent reporting about what precisely went wrong when a matcher fails. Bare assertions lack this and a look through the Go tests shows a lot of reinventing-the-wheel to provide what probably amounts to inconsistent error output to the developer. Why not put that all in one place, call it a matcher library, and make it dead easy to write custom matchers? - And @shoo: yes, thanks for pointing it out: the example is somewhat fabricated and isn&#x27;t a compelling argument for BDD vs XUnit. It&#x27;s hard to cook up a good BDD example in very short space!",

    "text": "(context: i&#x27;ve been working mainly with python, and have almost no experience with go) My initial reaction to the example was that it looked like something that could be easily unit-tested, without the added layer of BDD over the top. But that&#x27;s probably just a symptom of the example appearing as something that would be simple to build and test. E.g. in python i&#x27;d translate `Expect(scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;]).To(Equal(1))` to `assert scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;] == 1` which is essentially the same, but only uses one bit of machinery (assert) rather than three. That said, the more ways to test things the merrier. I think if you are interested in testing larger chunks of functionality &#x2F; user-facing bits of behaviour rather than invariants of the building blocks of your program, then perhaps BDD starts to look more appealing, so the two approaches seems complementary. Having an expressive static type system is again complementary, as that prevents you from making many trivial errors, and you just have to test for the remaining ones that the type system cannot express. (i miss that in python) after a little dig through the code, it looks like &quot;EXPECT foo TO EQUAL barr&quot; translates as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;gomega.go#L15 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L27 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;actual.go#L48 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers.go#L7 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onsi&#x2F;gomega&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;matchers&#x2F;equal_ma... so there&#x27;s lots of `interface{}`s and reflection and so on",

For example, on 2.4 GHz 802.11 protocols, there are 11 channels from 1 to 11. All wireless routers operating in US have to be on one of the 11 channels. When there are other wireless APs within the range, you and others share the channel. There&#x27;s a limitation on how much bandwidth a channel can give in total. That&#x27;s the hard limitation, given that CSMA&#x2F;CA works well. That&#x27;s why channel 3 and channel 8 often work great (most wireless routers have default channel choice 1, 6, or 11) - they are far away from defaults that others are using. Same thing applies to 5 GHz 802.11 networks. Now back to this project. 1 km is really long distance. You get communication range as large as a circle with radius being 1 km. There are a lot of wireless devices that fall in this range. You might not get affected by them since they don&#x27;t have that powerful antennas, but your signals will effectively lower the bandwidth of all routers in the area.",

In social-graph-optimisation the overt act is much higher granularity - its to follow &#x2F; friend another person. So the game is to join as many graphs as possible, or to find the graph of the person you want, and join that. I think this granularity problem will severely limit the acceptance of SEO-for-social-graphs. Seo right now works because it is possible to finesse at the right granularity level as a function of a users action. Geo-location work will also massively help - but social is effectively painting ads onto my friends T-Shirts in the hope I will read them. I struggle to see the next fine grained action (*) We need a better term than social media, because this is all just variations on an individual has their own webspace, and updates that space regularly, plus a central scraping service to let others know.

    "text": "Well, it's actually a bit more complicated than that. The bug is definitely something we wanted to know about, and we're thankful for the report. That said, there are some constraints that we put in place for the reward program to protect researchers from harm. For example, we don't want physical security or the police second-guessing the intent of someone trying to sneak into one of our buildings - so we set a very clear scope for the program, pragmatically focusing on our user-facing applications and excluding things such as attacks on our facilities and corporate infrastructure. It's a broad exclusion, but it's hard to come up with something finer-grained yet clear enough. In the same vein, we ask researches that they don't go after any systems unless it's perfectly clear that the application is owned and operated by us - for example, because it's in an IP range registered to us. Again, while this may be more limiting than we'd like, it protects the community against overly litigious parties if the system proves to belong to somebody else. In several unusually serious cases, we have made case-by-case exceptions and have paid external researchers for nominally non-qualifying bugs; but it's a tricky balance, and we use this power very cautiously.

They were building software in well trodden territory with a clear scope and execution path.

Read it back to yourself: &#62; Search Engine Optimization They're already liars. They aren't optimizing anybody's search engine. They're optimizing HTML so that it can be easily parsed and crawled, but that doesn't sound as sexy. It's marketing hocus pocus, tantamount to chart reading for day traders in the stock market. Just like chart readers, gazing into the Rorschach blots of spikes and trends in the stock market, they don't truly understand, and can't honestly answer to, how their composite numbers tie back to reality. They honestly have no control over the search engines they claim to optimize for, and have only an outsider's probed understanding of the internal workings of the search engines they target. The exception to this is when former employees of search engines are hired as consultants at these places that claim to offer these services, but honestly aside from that sort of intra-industry incest, what else do they have to offer? SEO as a term is a throwback to the late 90's when a lot of people didn't really understand what search engines do, and got sold on a trend. Yes, yes, robots.txt. Yes, unobtrusive JavaScript. Yes, structure your DOM in a well-organized, logical manner. Yes, simplify unauthenticated link URLs, and try to correlate references semantically. Yes, use the alt, title and name attributes, to further orient semantics. I get it, okay. Y'know, these same ideas overlap well-enough with accessibility standards. Anything beyond this kind of coding practice is really either link spam, or simple tasks like requesting that a search engine crawl your domain. And that's a marketing campaign. Nothing is being optimized. Can I stop putting this archaic buzzword on my resume? I don't optimize search engines, and unless you're posting an ad for a position at one, neither do you.

I'm still not sure how the new software will ease the problems that forums face. i) Web searching a problem returns a hit for a forum. I visit the forum, to see someone asking my question, and someone else saying \"Search the web, noob\". ii) People just love feeding trolls. It's trivially easy for trolls to disrupt forums. iii) Vested_Contributors - forums have rules. New users get punished for not following the rules; long term users have people making excuses for them (\"It's Bob! Everyone knows Bob! And he makes great posts normally, so let him off this time!\"). iv) Signal : Noise - and this is made worse by having limited number of posts per page.

    "text": "To dominate a radio spectrum usualy ends up with who has the strongest transmitter. BUT in todays digital age and more refined tunning of radio's into more decimal places. Then I believe the following approach would be the best approach for less power. Pick your target spectrum range, Then using a highpower transmitter higher powered than the other as above to do a very granular spectrum hopping around the spectrum but at least transmitting on every channel within that spectrum at a period of frequency that would be greater than normal error corrected interferance by that your signal would then cover the spectrum range alocated but instead of having to do a wide band of the entire spectrum you are picking channels (by channels I mean frequency range that is not interfeared with by either side as you can have a transmission on wifi say that is on channel 3 and can be picked up faintly if your on channel 1, bad example but you should follow what I'm meaning by channel in this case of a spectrum block) at a time interval that would exceed error correction and as such rendering others use of the channel extreemly hard and with that all channels in the defined frequency range, aka spectrum. Now by doing that you would need the least amount of power to block others use of that spectrum and at the same time have a very wide albeit spectrum hopping chunk of bandwith to use and abuse and the faster you make the spectrum hopping to break error handerling of others trying to use that range. Of course with that approach you would have details to work on like frequency channels and how granular you defined those and also the level of error correction you wish to defeat. Remember if you want to compete with others digital transmissions then this is great BUT with analogue it may very well be a case that somebody talking would still be understandable with the level of interfearance. A look at signal type and how it would be analoguely(sic) interpreted is one aspect that may effect how you encode your data as you may end up disrupting the receaving speaker enough to impeede the other signals sound transmision. There is also the aspect of how long you stay on a channel at certain frequencies with some needing longer than others to transmit something usable and the fun of recieving the signal out of step as different frequencies propergate(travel) at different rates(speed) so that would cause out of step reception, though easily countered if your aware of that design aspect. NOW there is a far far easier way and sadly I don't think it is what I would calla hacker approach and is more the script-kiddie solution. That would be to send a silly large pulse on the frequency so strong that it blows all the transmitters. Now you would need to inform your chaps ahead so they could switch of and fold there areils in half type of thing ahead of your radio nuke or more a radio DOS attack. Then they could setup ready afterwards and you would of blown all other recievers and with that the only people who can listern are those you want to listern. Not elegant, but certainly a partial solution that would be cheap to implement as it is that crude, hence not what I call a pure hacker solution. I also suspect the amount of power to do this would exceed the prize money being offered, so you would be pushed and indeed insane to build and test such an approach.",

The core purpose of SEO is to do exactly what you said here: \"The whole premise of the open web is that natural selection would allow rich information to be filtered through because it is good.\" It's called Search Engine OPTIMIZATION for a reason.

If you're not getting traffic from search engines then you're not optimized and ranking for stuff when someone searches. That has nothing to do with the technical stuff like tags and more to do with the actual content. Looking at the data you provide, Hacker News accounts for almost 1/2 your visits, 1/4 on Twitter, then everything else. (BTW, you don't have % of NEW visits in your post which is a more interesting number to read.) The half life of content on Twitter is 3 hours ( http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/ ) which means you're only really visible for, at best, 1 day. Promotion on Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are great but, if I were a writer, I would want to see long-term visibility to new readers where I'm NOT promoting yourself. ... Like Google searches. Assume people are looking to compare Techstars with something else. The #1 search, according to Google Instant search, for \"techstars vs (something)\" is \"techstars vs y combinator\" If your post \"Given The Opportunity: Should You Do TechStars or YC\" showed up on the first page of Google then I would say you've been able to achieve great visibility without SEO. ..... But you don't even show up in the first 5 pages. So, I think you've confused Search Engine Optimization with visibility. (common mistake, actually) ------------ Let's look at your data.... You didn't analyse or provide any insight, which is what I think people should DO with data. (Full disclosure: I'm work in the analytics department for my company. I research and write code to answer these kinds of questions for clients) 2. Are people actually reading your blog? It says currently that the average pages per visit is about 2 and they're spending 0:52 seconds on your blog. The average adult reads 250-300 words every minute. ( http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy ) At a glance you average 150-200 word posts. Does that mean they're only reading half of the second page they go to (What is the time on page for second page?) What is the second page? Is it the home page or another blog post? The data you provide doesn't help to answer that. You didn't mention your \"% of Exits\". A bounce rate, by definition, is always visits that only visited one page and left. Therefore, \"% of Bounce rate\" isn't a good metric to look at for you because your average pages per visit is over 1. \"% of Exits\" sorted by the URL of the page would give you insight into your readers. If your \"% of Exits\" on your home page is really high, then it may mean your readers aren't finding anything interesting to read. Conversely, if the \"% of Exits\" is usually a blog post, that's OK, especially if it's their second page, it means they may have read two posts then left. ------------ 3. Are you gaining new readers / are old readers coming back? You said that the percentage of new visits is 70%. Over the past year is that increasing, decreasing, or going all over the place? What about \"% of returning visits?\" If you're trying to go after new readers, great job. I would think making sure they return for more later is also important. I don't think you really want to be a one hit wonder. ------------ 4. Are your readers subscribing to your mailing list? It's on the right side of every page, so I'm guessing you want to make sure people notice it. Nobody wants spam, so if they subscribe you're almost guaranteed they like what you're writing. Are visitors subscribing to your mailing list? Is that number increasing? It's a good thing if they are.",

    "text": "It seems that to do shenanigans with Bitcoin would require the same care to avoid information leakage that would be required to do similar things with global digital payment networks and banks. The key would be to begin by considering any address linked to an identity that is you or related to you \"dirty,\" and to be careful about avoiding linkage to any of those dirty addresses. To really be careful I think you'd have to delve into graph theory and data mining a bit yourself, or follow the precautions of someone who knows what they're talking about. You'd also have to take care to pay attention to network addresses under the protocol, using Tor or similar proxying systems and considering any address that's been used from an IP that can be linked to you similarly \"dirty.\" Use of VPSes that accept anonymous payment would also be an option, though again... don't SSH to them from your house! Use Tor or smurf the data around by way of proxies and drop sites and such. Laundering money would require extreme caution to avoid such contamination, and would present many of the same challenges as money laundering in the fiat currency world. BTC/fiat conversions would be very risky. In-person BTC/fiat conversions are vulnerable to old fashioned gumshoe police work: \"hey, that BTC you exchanged on localbitcoin... you happen to remember what that guy looked like?\" These are also only feasible for small quantities. Large quantities would present a huge challenge. What this really means is that Bitcoin is not intrinsically an instrument for villainy as some lazy press articles make it out to be. In fact, criminal use of Bitcoin requires orders of magnitude more technical sophistication, which the vast majority of criminals do not have. A highly educated or sophisticated criminal or intelligence network could surely pull off shenanigans with Bitcoin, but I doubt your average thug or child porn wanker is going to even comprehend the stuff I wrote above. So at the very least, Bitcoin is only a criminal tool for very geeky high-IQ criminals.",

    "text": "I think perhaps Patrick didn't intentionally name it A/Bingo for the SEO, but he did understand the value OSS and link juice. If I thought of it, he certainly did -- but the name A/Bingo totally stands on its own as a really good name for this software in many ways. http://www.jcdrepair.com/blog/your-business-has-more-to-offe... Another example, and the one that inspired me, was one of the bloggers mentioned earlier. Patrick McKenzie runs a small, online business selling bingo cards to teachers (he sold over $45,000 worth of bingo cards in 2011). One thing Patrick does really well is search engine optimization (SEO). One of his techniques for getting people to link to his site (a big part of a high Google ranking), involves open source software. “What!?” That might be your reaction right now. What does open source software have to do with bingo cards for 1st graders? The answer is nothing. However, Patrick is a software developer that wrote the code for his bingo card website. He recognized that some of the code he wrote was valuable all on its own. So he turned part of it into an open source Ruby on Rails project, put the code up on his site along with instructions on using it, and then told the world about it. What happened? All sorts of software developers, with no interest in bingo cards but a huge interest in his software, started linking to the portion of Patrick’s website that hosted this open source project. More links to his website meant a better ranking on Google which meant more sales of his bingo card creator. So while he didn’t directly sell his offering the way Amazon sold their’s, he did use it in a way that created more business for him.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure that this Mpemba Effect is folklore. The hot water must necessarily pass through the temperature that the cooler water starts at. In fact if we are to believe this than at some point the initially hot water and the initially cold water must, at some point, be the same (average) temperature. Why then would it start to cool faster? Options that I can think of 1) initially hot water cools very asymmetrically so some hot portion gives of heat (to the air!) faster 2) more rapid temperature change sets up strong convective currents that, because of momentum, stay around, causing the initially hot water to give up heat faster. These both seem very unlikely. Fluid water is a very good heat conductor (and air a good insulator) making it unlikely that there would be significant temperature gradients and intuition tells us that freezing water takes much longer than it takes any sort of current to die down. (also note that these two effects would act to cancel each other out) As for the reasons mentioned in the wikipedia article: 1)Definition of frozen: I suppose that this could account for the effect if you measured the time for cold water to completely freeze and hot water to reach 0 degrees C! But in general as long as you use the same metric this won't matter 2) Evaporation (reducing the volume to be frozen): So an initially hot fluid will evaporate more and I suppose result in a slightly smaller volume to freeze. Since the thermal mass is proportional volume and the heat transfer is proportional to area this is a real effect. However the % change in volume of any reasonable shape of water is so insignificant compared to the difference in energy of hot water and cold water that this effect is almost certainly negligible. (perhaps if the claim was hot water freezes faster than cold water if it is laid out in very very very thin sheets I would buy it because of this.) 3) Convection: see above. 4) Frost: Since the water must pass through the same temperature (0 C) for frost to start to build the frost must grow differently on initially hot water than initially cold. I really see no reason to believe this is the case 5)Super cooling: again, if the convective forces persist for a mush longer time than seems reasonable... 6) Solutes and dissolved gases: I mean if one fluid is a different chemical composition than the other then I suppose all bets are off, but I feel the claim of \"warmer water freezes faster than colder water\" implies they are both the same substance However the main reason I believe this to be an Urban Myth is that it makes such a good story. It fits our belief as a culture that there are weird things about science that we don't understand and it challenges our initial intuition in a memorable way. In addition it requires more effort to test than most of us are willing to put forth (including me: I would be very interested if someone would actually do the test recommended in the wikipedia article.) Lastly; hot water freezing faster is a much better story than the other way around. Telling people that hot water freezes faster makes you seem to have some kind of secret knowledge; a spell you can cast over ice cube trays to make them into ice faster. I bet a reasonable rule for judging truth is that, all else being equal, the better story is less likely to be the true one, because if the truth was also the better story then no one would tell the boring one.",

    "text": "No doubt, there are plenty of cases when medication is the right option. However, there are many more cases where it's not. How we do psychology? We take a bunch of symptoms that seem to coincide with a group of individuals and we label it as a disorder : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd#DSM-IV_criteria The fact that these symptoms exist and cause problems for many individuals is of no question - that's why we have a \"disorder\" label associated with it. There is no dispute that medication is effective in treating these symptoms, either. However, the claim that medication \"even more effective\" is flimsy, if not flat out wrong. The problem is that there are many more studies devoted to the \"effects of ritalin on ADHD\" than there are to the \"effects of exercise and ADHD.\" Or meditation, or biofeedback, or eating 7 lbs of celery a day, or whatever. To make the claim that \"drugs are more effective\" is easier because studies of this nature are more prevalent - but it doesn't make it right. That would be a total confirmation bias. A difficulty in comparing medication to other methods is that medication = instant gratification and instant results. You eat a pill. A half hour later, you are focused, less scattered and more attentive. In the similar way to how coffee wakes you up if you are tired. It's easy to make an experiment out of such results. Exercise, in contrast, isn't instant. Exercise increases levels of nor-epinephrine and dopamine... but not nearly as rapidly (or with as little work) as an amphetamine compound. Steady and healthy levels of serotonin (which is now being studied as another player in the ADHD game) don't begin to rise until weeks of daily exercising. It may be slower, but our bodies are capable of changing, and for quantities of any given chemical being pumped out to increase, you need to keep doing things that keep causing it to be released. You need to form habits that make your body more effective at producing it's own chemical cocktails. Take a basic course in human physiology or neuroscience if you don't believe how amazing and capable our bodies and brains are at adapting and improving. Furthermore, a disorder label can easily be misconstrued by a young individual with ADHD. They might think to themselves, \"Wow, finally, a word to describe all the problems I'm having. It's not my fault after all, I'm sick, and I need medicine.\" It sucks because instead of really trying to go beyond the condition by using their will, they may give up and go the route of altering their minds externally - just to keep up with their peers. Is that a bad thing? Well, I'll leave that up to the reader. It is my personal opinion that that overcoming challenges of ADHD is not only possible through other, healthier methods (exercise, meditation and learning/coping strategies), but is more rewarding as well (speaking from personal experience). However, no one can do this by themselves - and it sucks that some people do not have the support, and that schools don't have a 15 minute exercise break every 3 hours, and that they don't let you eat snacks in class, and that we are constantly exposed to electronic stimulation from a very young age, that some of us don't learn how to control our intake of these things. Television, video games and other forms of electronic stimulation have been proven to release dopamine (Jeez, what doesn't?). A person with ADHD can easily focus to a show on TV with quickly changing camera angles, loud sounds, constant dialogue and continuous novelty. We grew up with this. But, when we are in class, we fidget, and daydream and blurt things out because this stimulation is not present, so our bodies are attempting to mitigate the dopamine withdrawal through the constant production of activity, of both the mind and the body. Finally, Ritalin hasn't been studied for 70 years. It's been about 40. It didn't start being used for ADHD until The late 60s, and wasn't in widespread use until the 90s - which is when the more serious studies began to come out. There's much more to say, but I'm getting tired :) Sources: http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-03-26-adhd-treatmen... http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041220013546.ht... http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/565830",

    "text": "Most of the criticism (I think) revolves around the methodology being biased towards unambitious projects. The economists were asked to rank proposals according to how much good they would do in alleviating existing world problems. The premise is a limited budget roughly based on 'aid budgets'. I think climate change should have been left outside of what they were looking at altogether for lots of reasons. The projects are too uncertain to be ranked. Putting an extra $1b towards existing climate change projects may result in absolutely no effect on climate change. We are talking about risky, expensive projects. An economist doesn't really know if a propaganda campaign to convince americans or Chinese to sign some deal is better then some geo-engineering technology project to directly cool the earth. It is outside the realm of what smart economists are good at. - It is coming out of different pockets. Climate change affects rich countries too. It is self interested spending. Certainly, there are tragedy of the commons like problems. But it is still in the interest of those spending to spend. - The effects of climate change are uncertain and indirect. One of the potential climate change issues is decreased glacial melt in India resulting in less summer river flows in to Pakistan. India is entitled (by treaty) to a fixed (in litres) amount of water. Pakistan needs this water to grow food without which it will be in famine. This could result in, mass refuge crisis, nuclear war, etc. It is virtually impossible to link something like that directly to an increase or decrease of $500m in spending by some NGO. *But...

    "text": "I always do a fixed rate for my work and go out of my way to help customers, sometimes years later, with simple problems for free. Guess who they call when they have another job? Me. Guess how much more they're willing to pay than new clients? A lot more. Customer service being a first priority is not just a marketing phrase - it really does make a huge difference. That being said, it is very important to define a clear scope, explain how much extra certain pieces would cost if they go out of scope, etc. Most clients are very receptive to changes in the quote - note the use of the word QUOTE - when the scope changes and you explain why it will cost more.",

    "text": "I agree that start-up is the problem, but sometimes users who just wander in can make a question-and-answer site very successful, even if the operator is obscure. What's crucial for getting lucky this way is good usability of the site and a crew of volunteer moderators as the site develops. My best example of success in a Q and A site is College Confidential. http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/ It isn't perfect, but it is chock full of information about the college admission process, and its online atmosphere of politeness and regard for other users' questions readily differentiates it from most other competitors running sites on the same subject. The site operator is pretty good at getting press notices and other free publicity, and quite good at search engine optimization, but mostly he's good at building a helpful and friendly online community.",

The field of AI itself is divided up into lots of sub fields such as logic theory, machine learning, language processing, search/optimization. Examples of \"AI research at work\" are the face detection in google picasa/iphoto ( machine learning + vision ). You email spam filter ( text classification ). As AI research matures and as computers get faster, its safe to say that there is definitely a greater demand for AI but its hard to come up with \"obvious\" applications of AI algorithms like the ones I listed above.",
