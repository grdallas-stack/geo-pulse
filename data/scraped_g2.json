I wanted to go with Airops at first but I saw several bad reviews, so now I'm leaning towards something like Promptwatch.\n\nBut before making a decision, I wanna know if you guys have better alternatives?

I’m looking at the deals on the Eclipse models at Sweetwater and I \\_really\\_ want this EverTune equipped version, but I am not a fan of the gold hardware. That leads to my actual question\\~\n\nWhat all items would be required to swap this over to black or chrome hardware, and how much would all of it cost in total? As far as I can tell (so somebody please chime in with anything I’ve missed)\\~ Tuners, pickup covers (Can you change/remove covers on the Fluence pickups??), EverTune saddles (I’m guessing those would be the single most expensive part of the whole hardware change), pickup selector switch, maybe the output jack, and I think that covers everything. Maybe some black or chrome screws to replace any glaring gold ones that remain but I can’t really see anything else that would have to get swapped over for me to love its appearance.\n\nAs others have said in this Subreddit recently, this price is like paying for an ET bridge and the Fishman pickups and getting an entire guitar, so I think I’m going to take advantage of the sale if I can and I’ll be looking for hardware to swap out the gold pieces.\n\nAny and all assistance is appreciated! I kinda figured I’m not the only one who feels this way about this guitar and the deal is almost too good to pass up so…somebody, let us know what all would be required to make this thing less “bling” and more “chug machine”.",

    "text": "This Sub is getting NOTHING done 💔\nsorry for the crappy drawing I didn't have an AI meme to rage bait people with 💔\n\nfirst and foremost I want to say as an artist I don't hate ai, Most people who are \"antis\" in this sub don't either, they use it everyday unless they live in a mountain, you can't truly get rid of it unless you're COMPLETELY detached from society.\n\nI think what people truly hate/dislike is the misuse and labeling of Generative ai, companies behind them, and the just the cons of Generative ai.\n\nlet's get one thing straight though, ai has been around for the longest time now, Since the 1960s as a matter of fact. It's nothing “new”, the reason everyone has their faces scrunched is because of recent, rapid, developments, and like I said, misuse and cons in the modern age of ai.\n\n This post specifically I want to provide facts off research I did, to educate both sides of the AI wars, and giving my honest opinion as an artistic individual (and relatively average joe) about my thoughts about ai\n\nBefore we weight pros and cons there were a few words that need to be defined (by yours truly)\n\nWHAT IS (GEN) AI?\n\nAi, short for artificial intelligence (duh) is a “computer brain” that does tedious specific jobs by observing and collecting data to do complex tasks. \n\nGenerative AI is when the AI created is specifically tasked to “create” original content based off the data it received so think painting, drawings, music, and most things artistically digital \n\nWHAT IS ART?\n\nArt is the creation of a LIVING BEING that elevates the mind of at least another creature. Basically if another living creature makes it and it makes you feel something as a conscious being then I would consider it art. (Key word being I as in it's what I, me, original poster, thinks) I think people would agree with me on that\n\nPROS AND CONS OF GEN AI\n\nPROS\n\nI don't use Gen AI often, but when I do it's mostly for education. It's good at teaching me, but most times I use it to get out of doing school work. (Which is always a plus for everybody)\n\nIt's easy to access, there are literally thousands upon thousands of ai gen models to reach, so long as you have a device\n\nIt makes people feel good, even though Gen AI users aren't artists it makes them feel good about being able to “make” something and call it their own. Chat ots are also made to cater to the user.\n\nIt's fast and effortless, anyone and everyone can use ai, if you're in a workplace that doesn't care, ai makes projects way faster.\n\nCONS\n\nIt's making people dumber. As I stated before I use Gen AI ,specifically chatgpt, to do school work, like most kids. Due to that it's made me and other teens overly reliant on it, refusing to do our work\n\nThere is nothing special about Gen AI content. Because it's easy to reach fast to make and there is an abundance of it. Making it there is nothing special about what you prompted which is why I really don't get AI art competitions.\n\nIt's stealing from real artists, AI needs to get it's data from somewhere, and artists are the ONLY source and smart artists aren't willingly giving up their work, so most times it's likely stolen.\n\nIt's not making art easier for anyone. “Ai lowers the barrier to entry” is the most nonsensical sentence I've ever heard, there has never been a barrier to entry, there is no secret club where real artists have everyone locked out. I started drawing when -\n\n\\-I was 5, my grandma started last year and she's 89, both of us started with a pencil and lined paper. Heck you can use a water bottle to draw on the pavement, or use rubber bands as strings for a DIY guitar. Point is, a wooden pencil isn't all an artist needs to make art, anything (besides ai) works\n\n\\-The only reason most people don't want to start is because of their fear of failure, if you've lived life for more than 10 years, you'll realize failure is needed for improvement on everything. \n\nIt's super restrictive. There are 2 examples that come to mind when I think of restrictive gen ai 1. Imagine you make AI promoted art for a client, and they want you to change 1 thing on the drawing without another regeneration, how would you go about that? 2 Let's say tomorrow all image generation sites were taken offline. What then? A true artist has multiple ways to adapt to any problems. Especially in the case of disabled people .\n\nAi is making living conditions worse environmentally, Everytime you use generative ai, it runs hundreds of calculations to figure out what you want. Those calculations tend to make chips heat up, and water is needed to cool things down. Most times the water gets dirty and is recycled (recycling costs more tho so the greedy corpos probably won't do allat lol) \n\n1 or 2 people using ai wouldn't be a problem, but like I said earlier. Millions of people use air, and that water really starts to add up. Taking water away from people in neighboring towns, It not just the water it's also light pollution, which is another entirely different ball park\n\nThe Companies behind Gen AI only care for money not information. Grok doesn't fact check anymore, btw, it's going purely off vibes now. As well as a lot of other Gen AI that “hallucinate” their answers, and have been seen doing it on multiple occasions (I can confirm, this happened to me while I was doing an assignment where got hallucinated a whole page that wasn't even apart of the book I was reading)\n\nGen AI users are misusing and mislabeling their content. Gen AI is not being used as a tool by its user's, instead it's being used as the artist itself to make art. Gen AI is also being used to make things like Child 🌽 by the users (and before people start coming towards me with things like “that was a thing before ai” I'm aware, I've always hated and I still do because AI has made it so accessible\n\nCONCLUSION \n\nMy final thoughts on gen ai is I think it should be heavily modified and laws should be put into place as to what can and cannot be made with it since it's not going away. I think Gen AI shouldn't be considered art (for another plethora of reasons but this post is alr long enough) and unless you truly love art, you should start learning on how to do it by your own 2 hands, or feet, or ear, or wherever else. If you actually read the post and want to argue please be civil, I probably missed a bunch of other points for pro, so feel free to educate me in the comments.

    "text": "Best AI Visibility Tracking Tools for Marketing Teams (2026 Guide)\n\nI've been doing SEO and digital marketing for about eight years now, and honestly, the last 18 months have been wild. Just when I thought I had Google figured out, AI Overviews started showing up in 16-19% of searches, and suddenly everyone's asking me: \"How do we track if ChatGPT is recommending our brand?\"\n\nThree months ago, my boss came to me with this exact question after our competitor started getting mentioned in AI responses while we were nowhere to be found. That's when I dove deep into AI Visibility Tracking tools, and let me tell you – it's been a learning curve.\n\n## Why AI Visibility Tracking Matters in 2026\n\nHere's the thing that really hit me: 40% of people aged 18-34 are now using AI tools for research. That's not some distant future trend – that's happening right now. When someone asks ChatGPT \"what's the best project management tool for small teams,\" your brand either shows up or it doesn't. There's no page 2 to fall back on.\n\nThe shift toward AI Visibility Tracking has become impossible to ignore for marketing teams. I've seen companies lose significant market share simply because they weren't visible in AI-generated responses, even though their traditional SEO was solid.\n\nWhat really opened my eyes was when I started tracking our own brand mentions. We were ranking #3 on Google for our main keyword, but when I tested the same query across different AI platforms, we weren't mentioned at all. Meanwhile, a competitor ranking #7 was getting cited consistently. That's when I realized we needed to start thinking differently about visibility.\n\n## AI Visibility vs Traditional SEO: What's Actually Different\n\nLook, I love traditional SEO. It's been my bread and butter for years. But AI visibility is a different beast entirely. With traditional SEO, you're optimizing for search algorithms that crawl and index pages. With AI visibility, you're trying to get cited by language models that synthesize information from multiple sources.\n\nHere's what I've learned about the key differences:\n\n**Traditional SEO focuses on:**\n- Keyword rankings and SERP positions\n- Click-through rates and organic traffic\n- Page authority and backlink profiles\n- Technical optimization for crawlers\n\n**AI visibility is about:**\n- Citation frequency across AI responses\n- Context and sentiment of mentions\n- Share of voice in AI-generated content\n- Authority signals that AI models trust\n\nThe weird part? Sometimes these don't align at all. I've seen pages with terrible traditional SEO metrics get cited frequently by AI models because they had unique, authoritative information that the AI found valuable.\n\n## How to Evaluate Visibility Tools for Your Team\n\nAfter testing about a dozen different platforms over the past few months, I've figured out what actually matters when choosing these tools. When evaluating Visibility Tools for your marketing stack, consider these key factors:\n\n**Multi-Model Coverage**: Your tool needs to track more than just ChatGPT. Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity all have different citation patterns, and you need visibility across all of them.\n\n**Prompt Variety**: The best tools let you test both branded and non-branded queries. It's one thing to see if \"What does [YourCompany] do?\" mentions you, but it's more valuable to know if \"best CRM for small business\" includes your brand.\n\n**Citation Context**: Not all mentions are equal. Getting cited as a negative example isn't the same as being recommended as a solution. Look for tools that provide sentiment analysis and context around mentions.\n\n**Competitor Tracking**: You need to see the full competitive landscape. If your competitor is getting mentioned and you're not, you need to understand why.\n\n**Integration Capabilities**: The tool should play nice with your existing SEO and marketing stack. Standalone tools are fine, but integration saves time and provides better insights.\n\n## Top SEO Visibility Tools Comparison\n\nAlright, let's get into the actual tools. I've spent real money testing these platforms, so this isn't theoretical – it's based on hands-on experience. Traditional SEO Visibility Tools are evolving to include AI-powered features, but some are definitely ahead of the curve.\n\n### 1. Dageno AI\n\nI'll be honest – I was skeptical about Dageno AI at first because it's newer than some of the established players. But after using it for two months, it's become my go-to platform.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n- The AI Citation Tracking feature is incredibly detailed. It doesn't just tell you if you're mentioned; it shows you the exact context and sentiment\n- Multi-model monitoring across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini with real-time updates\n- The SEO integration is seamless – I can see traditional rankings alongside AI visibility in one dashboard\n- Prompt Gap analysis helped me identify queries where competitors were getting cited but we weren't\n\n**Best for:** Teams that want both traditional SEO and AI visibility tracking in one platform\n\n**Pros:**\n- Unified dashboard reduces tool switching\n- Excellent competitor analysis features\n- Knowledge Graph injection feature (this one's pretty cool)\n- Responsive customer support\n\n**Cons:**\n- Newer platform, so less historical data\n- Learning curve if you're used to traditional SEO tools\n\n\n\n\nOne user testimonial that really resonated with me: \"Dageno didn't just track mentions; it identified specific semantic gaps we missed. The Knowledge Graph injection feature is pure magic.\" That matches my experience – the insights go beyond just tracking.\n\n### 2. Peec AI\n\nPeec AI has been around longer and has a solid reputation in the space. I tested their platform for about six weeks.\n\n**What works well:**\n- Multi-platform monitoring is reliable\n- Good reporting structure with branded vs non-branded prompt sets\n- Share-of-voice analysis is helpful for competitive positioning\n- More affordable than some alternatives\n\n**Best for:** Marketing teams that need structured reporting and don't want to break the budget\n\n**Pros:**\n- Cost-effective pricing at $99/month\n- Clean, intuitive interface\n- Good customer onboarding process\n- Reliable data accuracy\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited integration with other SEO tools\n- Fewer advanced features compared to newer platforms\n- Reporting can be slow during peak times\n\n### 3. Rankability AI Analyzer\n\nThis one's interesting because it's built by the team behind Rankability's content optimization tools. If you're already using their platform, the integration is smooth.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Prompt-level testing is very granular\n- Competitive citation comparison is detailed\n- Content optimization integration works well\n- Good for agencies already in the Rankability ecosystem\n\n**Best for:** Agencies using Rankability who want to add AI visibility tracking\n\n**Pros:**\n- Seamless workflow if you're already using Rankability\n- Detailed prompt analysis\n- Good agency-focused features\n\n**Cons:**\n- Less valuable if you're not using other Rankability tools\n- Higher price point at $149/month\n- Steeper learning curve\n\n### 4. LLMrefs\n\nLLMrefs positions itself as the budget-friendly option, and for smaller teams or solo marketers, it might be worth considering.\n\n**What it does well:**\n- Live keyword crawling is fast\n- Weekly trend reports are useful\n- Competitor benchmarking covers the basics\n- Most affordable option at $79/month\n\n**Best for:** Solo marketers, startups, or teams just getting started with AI visibility tracking\n\n**Pros:**\n- Affordable entry point\n- Simple interface\n- Quick setup process\n- Good for basic monitoring needs\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited advanced features\n- Fewer AI models covered\n- Basic reporting compared to premium tools\n- Customer support can be slow\n\n### 5. SE Ranking (AI Visibility Module)\n\nSE Ranking added AI visibility tracking to their existing SEO suite, which makes sense if you're already using their platform.\n\n**Integration benefits:**\n- Everything in one platform if you're already an SE Ranking user\n- Brand mentions monitoring works well\n- Link tracking integration is useful\n- Familiar interface for existing users\n\n**Best for:** Teams already using SE Ranking for traditional SEO\n\n**Pros:**\n- No need to learn a new platform\n- Good integration with existing SEO data\n- Reasonable pricing at $119/month\n- Established customer support\n\n**Cons:**\n- AI features feel like an add-on rather than core functionality\n- Less specialized than dedicated AI visibility tools\n- Limited advanced AI-specific features\n\n## My Honest Take After Testing All These\n\nAfter spending months with these tools, here's what I've learned: there's no perfect solution yet. The market is still evolving, and each tool has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIf I had to pick one for most marketing teams, I'd probably go with Dageno AI. The combination of traditional SEO and AI visibility tracking in one platform just makes sense for how most teams work. The insights are actionable, and the interface doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.\n\nFor budget-conscious teams or those just starting out, LLMrefs provides good basic functionality without breaking the bank. And if you're already invested in SE Ranking or Rankability, their AI modules are worth exploring.\n\nThe best AI Monitoring Tools provide real-time insights across multiple platforms, but remember – these tools are only as good as the actions you take based on their data. I've seen teams get caught up in vanity metrics instead of focusing on what actually drives business results.\n\n## What I Wish I'd Known Before Starting\n\nA few things I learned the hard way:\n\n1. **Start with a clear strategy**: Don't just track everything. Focus on the queries that actually matter for your business.\n\n2. **AI visibility doesn't replace traditional SEO**: It complements it. You still need solid fundamentals.\n\n3. **Context matters more than frequency**: Being mentioned once in the right context is better than being mentioned five times as a cautionary tale.\n\n4. **The landscape changes fast**: What works today might not work in six months. Stay flexible.\n\n## Questions for the Community\n\nI'm curious about your experiences with AI visibility tracking:\n\n1. **Have you noticed changes in your organic traffic that you can attribute to AI Overviews or other AI-powered search features?** I'm seeing about a 15% shift in our traffic patterns, but I'd love to hear if others are experiencing similar changes.\n\n2. **For those who've implemented AI visibility tracking, what metrics do you focus on?** Are you tracking citation frequency, sentiment, share of voice, or something else entirely?\n\n3. **What's your biggest challenge with AI visibility right now?** Is it tool selection, strategy development, or something else I haven't considered?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. This space is moving so fast that we're all learning together.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: I've tested all these tools with my own money and time. None of these companies know I'm writing this post, so these are my genuine opinions based on hands-on experience.*\n\n---\n```",

    "text": "I Spent $3,000+ Testing Every AI Visibility Tool So You Don't Have To... Here's What's Actually Worth It in 2026\n**TL;DR:** The AI visibility tracking space just went through a brutal shakeout, and most of what survived still isn't worth the price tag. After months of hands-on testing, I found that the majority of tools charge $400–600+/month for fancy dashboards that don't tell you what to do. Here's the honest breakdown of what delivers results and what's just expensive noise.\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room. ChatGPT now handles over 4.2 billion queries a month. Claude usage surged 127% in a single quarter. Perplexity blew past 100 million monthly active users. Google's AI Overviews appear on 93% of commercial searches. And 78% of consumers — up from 64% just one quarter ago — now kick off product research inside an AI tool.\n\nIf your brand isn't showing up in those answers, you don't exist to a growing chunk of your market. Full stop.\n\nI've been deep in the weeds testing these platforms, spending real money, running controlled experiments, and comparing outputs side by side. Q4 delivered some harsh lessons. Here's what I found.\n\n# The Market Shakeout Was Brutal\n\nOver $120M poured into AI visibility tools this year. But here's what nobody's tweeting about: roughly half the \"game-changing\" platforms that launched have since pivoted, been quietly absorbed, or simply vanished. The market consolidated fast, and the survivors aren't all winners — some just had deeper pockets.\n\n# Enterprise Tier ($500–2000/month): Polished, But Is It Enough?\n\n# Profound — $500–600/month base\n\nI put Profound through a rigorous test with a B2B SaaS client — 50 identical prompts benchmarked against competitors. Their tracking infrastructure is solid. Dashboards look incredible in a boardroom setting, and their enterprise support genuinely delivers if you need someone to walk you through every metric.\n\nWhere it fell short: the competitive intelligence. Their system flagged three \"competitors\" — two of which weren't remotely in the same market, and the third was common knowledge. The root issue? They're applying keyword overlap logic borrowed from traditional SEO, but AI systems don't cluster brands that way. They group by context, relationships, and how users frame queries.\n\n**Strengths:** SOC 2 compliance, SSO, dedicated account teams, presentation-ready reporting. If your procurement department needs a blue-chip vendor name on the invoice, Profound checks that box.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Thin on prescriptive guidance. You'll see that your visibility score dipped, but you won't get a concrete playbook for fixing it. At $600/month, that's a significant gap.\n\n**Ideal for:** Fortune 500 organizations where vendor compliance and internal optics outweigh cost efficiency.\n\n# Evertune — €450–800/month\n\nIf Profound is the polished executive, Evertune is the tenured professor. Their statistical methodology is rigorous — 50,000-prompt samples, confidence intervals, p-values, the works. For industries where you need to defend an AI strategy to a skeptical CFO or regulatory board, this level of rigor is genuinely valuable.\n\nThe catch: speed. You'll wait 2–3 weeks for insights that a faster tool delivers in days. For most businesses, that tradeoff doesn't make sense. For pharma or financial services? It might.\n\n**Strengths:** Research-grade data quality that withstands serious scrutiny. If your decisions require academic-level confidence, this is unmatched.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Painfully slow turnaround. Expensive. Recommendations remain surface-level despite the data depth.\n\n**Ideal for:** Regulated industries (pharma, finance, legal) where auditability and statistical defense are non-negotiable.\n\n# Mid-Market Tier ($120–400/month): A Mixed Bag\n\n# Peec AI — €400/month (full platform)\n\nI tested Peec with the same B2B SaaS brand. Their competitive analysis surfaced four \"competitors\" — but two were actually complementary products that AI systems frequently recommend *alongside* the brand, not as replacements. That's a fundamental misread of how AI contextualizes brands.\n\nCredit where it's due, though: their GDPR compliance is best-in-class. If you're an EU-based company and data residency requirements are a hard line, Peec has genuinely thought through those details better than anyone else I tested.\n\n**Strengths:** Strongest GDPR implementation in the space. Solid tracking interface. European support hours that actually overlap with your workday.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Competitive analysis methodology is flawed. Limited to 2–3 platforms depending on tier. Feature development has stalled noticeably since mid-year.\n\n**Ideal for:** EU-headquartered companies where data privacy compliance eliminates most alternatives from consideration.\n\n# Otterly AI — Mid-market pricing, global reach\n\nTheir 12-country coverage is legitimately impressive for internationally distributed brands. But the fact that you're still manually entering prompts in Q4 2025? That's inexcusable. Automation is table stakes at this price point, and their \"coming soon\" beta doesn't cut it.\n\n**Strengths:** Geographic breadth that's hard to match for multi-market operations.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Manual workflows feel like a product from two years ago. Automation remains aspirational.\n\n**Ideal for:** Global brands needing multi-country tracking who can tolerate hands-on grunt work.\n\n# The One That Changed My Mind: \n\nI'll be upfront — I went in skeptical. Another platform claiming to be the one that *actually gets it*? I'd heard the pitch a dozen times.\n\nThen I ran a controlled head-to-head comparison: same brand, same 50 prompts, same timeframe, tested against Profound and Peec simultaneously. The gap was real.\n\n**What makes it different starts with how it identifies competitors.** Where Profound and Peec both flagged incorrect competitors using keyword overlap logic, VisibilityAI.co analyzed how AI engines actually position brands within their responses — tracking contextual relationships, not just topical similarity. It caught nuances the others missed entirely, identifying brands that surface in similar AI answer contexts even when they wouldn't show up as traditional competitors.\n\nBut the true differentiator is what happens after the data comes in: **actionable, specific recommendations.**\n\nMost tools tell you something vague like \"improve your content strategy.\" VisibilityAI.co tells you:\n\n* *\"Create a comparison guide covering \\[X vs Y vs Z\\] — you're losing this query cluster to Competitor X because their content gets cited 3:1 over yours on Perplexity.\"*\n* *\"Your content performs well on ChatGPT but underperforms on Claude and Gemini — here's why and what to adjust.\"*\n* *\"This Reddit thread is driving AI citations for your competitor. Here's how to create content that enters the same citation loop.\"*\n\nIt's clear this was built by people who've run campaigns, not just built dashboards. The platform focuses on what to *do* — the daily opportunity alerts alone (Reddit threads to engage with, content gaps to close, sources to target for citations) are worth more than most competitors' entire feature sets.\n\n**Core capabilities:**\n\n* Multi-engine tracking: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Google AI Mode, Reddit answers — all in one dashboard\n* Content gap analysis with ready-to-use briefs showing exactly where competitors get mentioned and you don't\n* Source attribution mapping — see precisely which domains AI engines cite when recommending brands in your space\n* Sentiment tracking across platforms with context, not just a number\n* Niche query discovery — find the high-intent questions in your category that trigger AI recommendations\n* Daily alerts on opportunities to influence AI answers through content and engagement\n\n**What works:** Best value-to-outcome ratio I've tested. Recommendation quality is a tier above the competition. Multi-engine coverage rivals or beats tools at 2–3x the price. Consistent product updates — they ship fast. Free tier available to test before committing.\n\n**What doesn't:** Newer brand with less enterprise name recognition than Profound — if your procurement team cares more about vendor prestige than output quality, that's a friction point. Enterprise features exist but aren't as polished as Profound's (no 24/7 dedicated support yet). Smaller customer base means fewer published case studies.\n\n**Ideal for:** The vast majority of businesses that need to know *what to do*, not just *what their score is*. Agencies that need client-facing deliverables with real substance. Any team where ROI matters more than the logo on the invoice.\n\n# What Actually Drives Results (Hint: It's Not Your Dashboard)\n\nAfter months of testing, I've stacked the value hierarchy. Here's what genuinely moves the needle versus what just looks good in a slide deck:\n\n**Tier 1 — Drives revenue:**\n\n1. Specific, prioritized recommendations (not \"create better content\" — tell me *what* to create and *why*)\n2. Accurate competitive intelligence based on how AI actually clusters brands, not keyword proximity\n3. Platform-specific guidance (what gets you cited on ChatGPT actively hurts you on Claude)\n4. Citation source tracking — which pages are AI systems actually pulling from?\n\n**Tier 2 — Helps with internal buy-in:** 5. Clean dashboards and exportable reports 6. Statistical confidence metrics 7. Historical trend visualization\n\nMost enterprise tools nail Tier 2 and struggle with Tier 1. VisibilityAI.co flips that — strong on 1–4, functional on 5–7. Your priorities should determine your pick.\n\n# The Pricing Math Nobody Wants to Do\n\nHere's an uncomfortable truth: the actual technology behind visibility tracking is no longer exotic. A competent engineering team can build a basic tracker in 2–3 months. The premium pricing persists because the market allows it, not because the technology demands it.\n\nThe genuinely difficult part — the part that justifies real spending — is generating *accurate, platform-specific recommendations* rooted in competitive gap analysis. That requires understanding how each AI engine actually reasons about brands, not just scraping and counting mentions.\n\nHere's what you're getting at each price point:\n\n|Tool|Monthly Cost|What You Actually Get|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|VisibilityAI.co|Free tier + paid plans|Specific daily recommendations, multi-engine tracking, content gap briefs, source attribution|\n|Profound|$600/month|Polished dashboards, enterprise compliance, \\~5 generic suggestions|\n|Peec AI|€400/month|Solid tracking, best-in-class GDPR, basic insights|\n|Evertune|€800/month|Statistical rigor, research-grade confidence, 2–3 week turnaround|\n\nNo tool is objectively \"wrong\" — it depends on what problem you're actually solving. But if your goal is improving your position in AI answers (not just measuring it), the value distribution is lopsided.\n\n# Your Roadmap Based on Where You Are\n\n**Months 0–3: Establish Your Baseline**\n\n* Run a free visibility check through VisibilityAI.co or HubSpot's grader to see if the problem is real\n* Manually track 10–20 high-priority prompts across 2–3 platforms\n* Focus exclusively on queries where real customers actually discover brands like yours\n\n**Months 3–6: Execute Systematically**\n\n* Choose a tool based on your actual priority (recommendations vs. compliance vs. vendor reputation)\n* *Implement* the recommendations — tracking without action is expensive spectating\n* Set up UTM parameters to measure AI-referred traffic properly\n\n**Months 6+: Scale and Optimize**\n\n* Integrate analytics for full attribution modeling\n* Build ROI measurement loops and iterate\n* Consider enterprise tiers only if managing multiple brands or regions\n\n# What Happened When Companies Actually Acted on Recommendations\n\nThe data from Q4 tells a clear story — the gap between companies that *track* and companies that *optimize* is massive:\n\n* **E-commerce brand:** 47% jump in AI-referred traffic within 60 days of implementing platform-specific recommendations\n* **B2B consultancy:** $230K in closed deals directly attributed to AI-driven discovery\n* **Agency portfolio:** Significant visibility gains across client accounts when executing on targeted content and citation strategies\n\nThe pattern is unmistakable: **recommendations create revenue. Dashboards create meetings.**\n\n# Strategies That Are Working Right Now\n\n**Entity Authority Building** — Build topic clusters where your brand consistently appears as the definitive source. AI engines prefer brands they can cite with confidence across multiple contexts.\n\n**Citation-Magnet Content** — Original research, comprehensive guides with proprietary data, expert interviews. Content that other sources naturally reference becomes the content AI engines reference.\n\n**Platform-Specific Optimization (Q4 updates):**\n\n* **ChatGPT:** Favors conversational, nuanced explanations. Bullet-point-heavy content is losing ground.\n* **Claude:** Rewards well-sourced perspectives that acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs. Shallow takes get skipped.\n* **Perplexity:** Research-backed content dominates. Recency weighting has tripled — fresh data wins.\n* **SearchGPT:** Still early, but initial signals favor brands with consistent cross-platform authority.\n* **Gemini:** Heavily integrated with Google's Knowledge Graph. Entity relationships and structured data matter most here.\n\n# My Honest Verdict After Testing Everything\n\n**For most businesses:** Start with VisibilityAI.co's free tools to see if visibility gaps exist. If they do, their paid plans give you the recommendations to actually close them. Scale up as you get serious about optimization.\n\n**For agencies:** VisibilityAI.co  lets you deliver tangible, action-oriented value to clients instead of recycling dashboard screenshots. The daily opportunity alerts alone justify the investment.\n\n**For enterprises with strict compliance needs:** Profound remains the safest bet if vendor vetting and 24/7 support matter more than cost. Their enterprise infrastructure is legitimately superior.\n\n**For EU-only brands:** Peec AI if data residency is non-negotiable. VisibilityAI.co is also worth evaluating if their data handling meets your requirements.\n\n**For regulated industries:** Evertune when you need bulletproof statistical confidence to justify budget decisions to a compliance board.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nThe AI visibility market has fractured into two distinct categories: tools that sell you a view of the scoreboard, and tools that tell you how to win the game. Most charge enterprise prices for the former while barely attempting the latter.\n\nTracking your visibility score is table stakes — any solid team can build that capability. What's genuinely valuable, and genuinely hard, is translating visibility data into accurate, platform-specific actions based on real competitive gap analysis.\n\nCompanies that are acting on recommendations right now are building 6–12 month compounding advantages. Everyone else is still debating what their visibility percentage means in a monthly review meeting.\n\nIgnoring AI visibility in Q4 2025 is the equivalent of dismissing SEO in 2010 — except AI-referred traffic converts at 2.3x the rate, making the cost of inaction significantly steeper.\n\n*What's your experience been with AI visibility? The landscape shifts monthly, and shared intelligence benefits everyone.*",

    "text": "The \"5g per day\" creatine recommendation is based on muscle research. Here's what the latest brain studies say.\nTL;DR: I have been taking 5g/day creatine for 3 years now and am now thinking to increase the per day dosage. After digging into 1000+ studies, I found some wild stuff about high-dose creatine for cognitive function. Single doses of \\~20g can increase processing speed by 24.5% and the effects last 9 hours. Also, vegetarians respond \\~2x better than meat-eaters. Full breakdown below with sources.\n\nWhy I did this:\n\nI have been taking 5g/day creatine for 3 years now. Like most people, I took the standard \"5g per day\" advice and never questioned it. It worked fine for my training, but I kept seeing conflicting claims about creatine for brain function. So I started reading actual papers to figure out if I should increase my dosage. 3 months and 1000+ studies later, here are the findings that genuinely surprised me:\n\n1. The \"5g for everyone\" dose is based on old muscle research, not brain optimization\n\nMost dosing recommendations come from 1990s studies measuring muscle saturation. But your brain is different.\n\nA 2024 study (Gordji-Nejad et al., Nature Scientific Reports) found that a single high dose of \\~0.35g/kg (\\~24.5g for a\n\n70kg person) during 21-hour sleep deprivation:\n\n• Improved processing speed by 24.5%\n\n• Increased brain creatine by 4.2%\n\n• Effects peaked at 4 hours and lasted up to 9 hours\n\n• Prevented the brain pH drop that normally happens during fatigue\n\nEven more interesting: A 2025 review (Fabiano &amp; Candow) analyzed dose-response data and found:\n\n• 2-5g/day = 4-6% brain creatine increase\n\n• 8-10g/day = 7-8% increase\n\n• 15-20g/day = 9-11% increase\n\nFor cognitive purposes, higher doses appear significantly more effective. This is exactly why I am now thinking to increase my per day dosage.\n\n2. Vegetarians get nearly 2x the cognitive benefit\n\nMultiple studies (Rae 2003, Benton 2011) show vegetarians have much lower baseline brain creatine and see dramatic improvements in working memory and reasoning after supplementation. One study found p &lt; 0.0001 for intelligence improvements in vegetarians, basically unheard of in nutrition research.\n\nMeat-eaters already get \\~1-2g/day from food, so their brains are partially saturated.\n\n3. Creatine does NOT cause kidney damage, dehydration, or cramping, but the myths persist\n\nThis one genuinely angered me. I found the original studies that started these myths and they're either:\n\n• Misinterpreted (one case study of someone with pre-existing kidney disease)\n\n• Actually showed the opposite (Greenwood 2003 found LESS cramping in NCAA football players taking creatine vs placebo\n\nThe ISSN Position Stand (2017) reviewed 1000+ studies and concluded: zero evidence of adverse effects in healthy individuals at recommended doses. Long-term studies go up to 21 months with no kidney function changes.\n\nAfter 3 years at 5g/day, my bloodwork is perfect. The safety data is rock solid.\n\n4. Women have been underserved by creatine research, but that is changing\n\nFor decades, most creatine studies excluded women or had tiny female sample sizes. Recent research (Smith-Ryan 2021) confirms creatine works for women without the \"bloating\" fears, benefits across the lifespan without marked body weightchanges.\n\nNew 2025 studies are specifically examining menstrual cycle effects and menopause benefits.\n\n5. The mechanism for brain benefits is fascinating\n\nYour brain is 2% of your body weight but uses 20% of your energy. During high cognitive demand or sleep deprivation, ATP in your prefrontal cortex gets depleted.\n\nCreatine acts as a rapid-response energy buffer, literally regenerating ATP in milliseconds. A 2015 study found 20g/day for 7 days increased corticomotor excitability by 70% during hypoxia (low oxygen).\n\n6. Meta-analysis data is stronger than most people realize\n\nI compiled the major meta-analyses:\n\n• Chilibeck et al. (2017): +1.37kg lean mass in older adults, n=721\n\n• Zhang et al. (2025): SMD 0.43 for strength gains across populations\n\n• Xu et al. (2024): SMD 0.31 for memory improvement, more beneficial for females\n\nEffect sizes this consistent are rare in nutrition science.\n\n7. Most \"advanced\" creatine forms are marketing\n\nCreatine monohydrate has the most research, is the cheapest, and has 95%+ bioavailability. Buffered creatine, creatine\n\nHCL, liquid creatine, none show superior absorption in head-to-head studies. The \"better absorption\" claims are mostly unproven.\n\nWhat I am doing differently now:\n\nAfter 3 years at 5g/day, I am now experimenting with:\n\n• For training: 5g/day consistently (works fine for muscle)\n\n• For cognitive demands: 15-20g single dose before intense mental work or when sleep-deprived\n\n• Timing: Post-workout with carbs when possible, but consistency matters most\n\nI am planning to try a month at 10g/day split into two doses to see if I notice cognitive differences, then potentially experiment with 15-20g on heavy work days.\n\nSources and Interactive Database:\n\nI organized all the major studies into a searchable database because I got tired of PDF hunting:\n\n[https://creatine-sandy.vercel.app](https://creatine-sandy.vercel.app/)\n\nIncludes:\n\n• 50+ major studies with effect sizes, sample sizes, and direct links to papers\n\n• Interactive myth-busting (click myths to reveal the actual research)\n\n• Dose-response visualizations for both muscle and brain benefits\n\n• Safety timeline from 1832 to 2025\n\n• Filterable by category: muscle, cognitive, safety, high-dose protocols\n\nEverything is cited with PubMed links if you want to read the full papers.\n\nQuestions I still have:\n\n1. Why has not the high-dose cognitive research filtered into mainstream recommendations yet? The 2024 Nature study se groundbreaking.\n2. Are there long-term (5+ year) studies on 10g+ daily dosing for cognitive purposes?\n3. What is the optimal cycling protocol for high-dose cognitive use vs continuous low-dose?\n4. For those who have increased from 5g to 10g+ long-term, what subjective differences did you notice?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone deep on this research or experimented with higher doses. What did I miss? Has anyone here gone from 5g to 10-20g daily? What was your experience?",

Creatine does NOT cause kidney damage, dehydration, or cramping, but the myths persist\n\nThis one genuinely angered me. I found the original studies that started these myths and they're either:\n\n• Misinterpreted (one case study of someone with pre-existing kidney disease)\n\n• Actually showed the opposite (Greenwood 2003 found LESS cramping in NCAA football players taking creatine vs placebo\n\nThe ISSN Position Stand (2017) reviewed 1000+ studies and concluded: zero evidence of adverse effects in healthy individuals at recommended doses. Long-term studies go up to 21 months with no kidney function changes.\n\nAfter 3 years at 5g/day, my bloodwork is perfect. The safety data is rock solid.\n\n4. Women have been underserved by creatine research, but that is changing\n\nFor decades, most creatine studies excluded women or had tiny female sample sizes. Recent research (Smith-Ryan 2021) confirms creatine works for women without the \"bloating\" fears, benefits across the lifespan without marked body weightchanges.\n\nNew 2025 studies are specifically examining menstrual cycle effects and menopause benefits.\n\n5. The mechanism for brain benefits is fascinating\n\nYour brain is 2% of your body weight but uses 20% of your energy. During high cognitive demand or sleep deprivation, ATP in your prefrontal cortex gets depleted.\n\nCreatine acts as a rapid-response energy buffer, literally regenerating ATP in milliseconds. A 2015 study found 20g/day for 7 days increased corticomotor excitability by 70% during hypoxia (low oxygen).\n\n6. Meta-analysis data is stronger than most people realize\n\nI compiled the major meta-analyses:\n\n• Chilibeck et al. (2017): +1.37kg lean mass in older adults, n=721\n\n• Zhang et al. (2025): SMD 0.43 for strength gains across populations\n\n• Xu et al. (2024): SMD 0.31 for memory improvement, more beneficial for females\n\nEffect sizes this consistent are rare in nutrition science.\n\n7. Most \"advanced\" creatine forms are marketing\n\nCreatine monohydrate has the most research, is the cheapest, and has 95%+ bioavailability. Buffered creatine, creatine\n\nHCL, liquid creatine, none show superior absorption in head-to-head studies. The \"better absorption\" claims are mostly unproven.\n\nWhat I am doing differently now:\n\nAfter 3 years at 5g/day, I am now experimenting with:\n\n• For training: 5g/day consistently (works fine for muscle)\n\n• For cognitive demands: 15-20g single dose before intense mental work or when sleep-deprived\n\n• Timing: Post-workout with carbs when possible, but consistency matters most\n\nI am planning to try a month at 10g/day split into two doses to see if I notice cognitive differences, then potentially experiment with 15-20g on heavy work days.\n\nSources and Interactive Database:\n\nI organized all the major studies into a searchable database because I got tired of PDF hunting:\n\n[https://creatine-sandy.vercel.app](https://creatine-sandy.vercel.app/)\n\nIncludes:\n\n• 50+ major studies with effect sizes, sample sizes, and direct links to papers\n\n• Interactive myth-busting (click myths to reveal the actual research)\n\n• Dose-response visualizations for both muscle and brain benefits\n\n• Safety timeline from 1832 to 2025\n\n• Filterable by category: muscle, cognitive, safety, high-dose protocols\n\nEverything is cited with PubMed links if you want to read the full papers.\n\nQuestions I still have:\n\n1. Why has not the high-dose cognitive research filtered into mainstream recommendations yet? The 2024 Nature study se groundbreaking.\n2. Are there long-term (5+ year) studies on 10g+ daily dosing for cognitive purposes?\n3. What is the optimal cycling protocol for high-dose cognitive use vs continuous low-dose?\n4. For those who have increased from 5g to 10g+ long-term, what subjective differences did you notice?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone deep on this research or experimented with higher doses. What did I miss? Has anyone here gone from 5g to 10-20g daily? What was your experience?",

    "text": "Title or where to read?\nI don't want to go with my brothers after my grandpa's death but I have no choice.\n\n\"Home sweet home.\" Gabriele says to me as he lets me out the car.\n\nBut I know. I know with my whole heart. This will never be my home.\n\n\\-\n\nBeep, beep, beep.\n\nNot dead. He's not dead.\n\nMy head falls into my hands and I scrunch my eyes shut, trying not to cry. \n\nThe doctors told me he had a pretty rough tumble, causing a fracture in his leg and arm, and after a traumatic head injury, he's slipped into a coma. \n\nAnd to top it all off, they've called my brothers to tell them the news.\n\nThey're on their way and I am shitting myself. \n\nMy leg is bouncing frantically and I can feel sweat beading on my forehead. \n\n\"Allora. Gabriele and I discussed this on the way to the hospital. You're going to stay with us from now on.\" Out of the blue.\n\n————————\n\nAllora PoV\n\nThud.\n\nI pause in my movements, expecting my grandfather to yell down the stairs for me to clean up whatever he must have dropped, but there's only silence. I wait a few more moments before deciding to confront the stairs. The creaking of the wooden steps have always creeped me out, but today they sound particularly loud, each echo increasing the thumping of my heart. I'm not supposed to come up without permission, but the eerie silence is making me brave enough to risk punishment.\n\nI open the door to the basement just an inch, just enough to peek out without getting caught. Out in the hallway, there's no sign of life. I wait a bit longer, indecision tearing at me. Maybe it's a test, or maybe it's a real shot at freedom. The latter sends a pulse of disobedient hope rushing down my spine.\n\n\"Grandfather?\" I call out quietly.\n\nDead quiet.\n\nI push the door a bit wider, and pause. Nothing. I poke my head through the door. Nothing. I take forbidden step out into the hallway, only resting the tips of my toes on the floorboards. Nothing.\n\nThe hope comes flooding back, and I stay in the shadows, staying close to the walls as I move further into the house. The door is so close. I can make it. I know I can. I can see it.\n\nJust as I reach out to grab the handle, stupidity makes me turn around and check, one more time, that there's not one around. I look into the room to my right, the living room.\n\nMy heart stutters and lurches into my throat.\n\nShoed feet, lying on the ground. At first, I don't know what I'm looking at, but then it hits me.\n\nMy grandfather.\n\nMy mind reels, my thoughts are going wild with imagination.\n\nI make no move to go to him, if I do, it becomes real. And if it becomes real, then my life is going to change. My life is going to change. Blood rushes to my head at the thought, making me dizzy with relief.\n\nBut then I pause. He might not be dead, and then all of this would just be a pause in a nightmare. I have two options now: call an ambulance and let them tell me my fate. Or leave. My heart screams at me to pack a bag and run into the streets but my brain fights back. Where would I go? I have no money, no job prospects, I'd be accepting a life in the streets for the rest of my life.\n\nMy feet decide for me, moving me to the house phone on the side table.\n\nI can only pray that the man on the floor is dead.\n\n\\---\n\nBeep, beep, beep.\n\nNot dead. He's not dead.\n\nMy head falls into my hands and I scrunch my eyes shut, trying not to cry. I'm in my grandfather's hospital room. A fall. That's all it was. The doctors told me he had a pretty rough tumble, causing a fracture in his leg and arm, and after a traumatic head injury, he's slipped into a coma. They don't know when exactly but they suspect he'll wake up in a couple days, maybe a week.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they've called my brothers to tell them the news. They're on their way and I am shitting myself. My leg is bouncing frantically and I can feel sweat beading on my forehead. I can't stay here. I cannot stay here. I, cannot, stay, here.\n\nTerror that I haven't felt since I was 12 assails me and before I can think it through, I'm throwing myself out of the chair and scrambling to the door. But before I can open it and run away forever, two large figures push through. Pure reflex lets me hop back in time to avoid crashing into them.\n\nThey're here.\n\nMy shot at freedom is ruined and I almost laugh hysterically at thinking I ever had a chance in the first place.\n\nThe two men were startled by my movements and now stare down at me in a mixture of confusion and disapproval. Disapproval! What do they have to be disappointed about? How can I have screwed up in two seconds? I can only stare back at them, and hope that they can't see the swirling emotions inside of me.\n\n\"Allora?\" Antonio asks. It's been a long time since I've seen them but I would recognise my brothers anywhere. He looks so different. And yet exactly the same. I believe he's 30 now, and the slight wrinkling at the corner of his eyes shows it, so does the few silvery strands streaking through his hair. He must be stressed if his grey hairs are already showing.\n\n\"Allora. Are you alright? You look at bit...\" Gabriele gestures vaguely at my entire body. He's three years younger than Antonio and yet they look so alike. The only difference is that Gabriele has black hair where Antonio has brown. I look like them too, I think. Well, I would if I had a bit more muscle or a bit less overall unkemptness, as so clearly pointed out by my brother.\n\nWhen I don't respond, Antonio raises a brow and then shrugs, clearly not caring that much. They then turn to my grandfather lying on his bed. \"Nonno, you look terrible.\" Antonio murmurs, moving closer and taking his poor, old, frail, wicked hand. Gabriele moves to do the same on grandfather's other side. The scene would be heartwarming to strangers, two grandchildren fretting over their coma-induced grandfather, and yet it stirs nothing within me. I might as well not be here for all anyone cares. I'm not welcome here. I know that even if they don't say it.\n\nI'm pulled out of my thoughts when Antonio clears his throat and addresses me, \"Allora. Gabriele and I discussed this on the way to the hospital. You're going to stay with us from now on.\" Out of the blue.\n\nGabriele doesn't give me any time to digest what's just been said before he jumps in, \"Yes. So we originally were going to have you stay with us just while he got better but we think it would be better for his health not to have to take care of you. We'll probably send him to a nursing home when he wakes up as well.\" I feel an eye twitch involuntarily, but otherwise I don't respond.\n\nAntonio takes my silence as confirmation and nods, \"So we'll set you up with a room, and you'll go to school and do whatever teens do these days.\" He checks his watch, \"In fact, we need to leave right now. The boys will be coming home soon.\"\n\nThat's it? They've said their words to Grandfather and now they're just going to leave? I don't know why I bother with these thoughts, I would never say them out loud and they're none of my business anyways. I just watch as the boys bid their sweet, lovely, evil grandpa goodbye and then walk out the door. I clearly have no other choice than to follow behind them, head held high but eyes empty at the thought of my new life.\n\nI don't want to go with them but I have no choice.\n\nThey walk me through the hospital, never turning back to make sure I'm still behind them. I bet if I stopped walking they wouldn't notice. The elevator ride proves to be the worst part, busy with hospital staff and visitors, I end up stuffed in a back corner, trying to make myself small enough to avoid touching my brothers in front of me. I hold my breath when the corner of Gabriele's jacket sleeve brushes against my arm. I don't like touch. Not anymore. I could go my whole life without touching another soul and that would be perfectly alright with me.\n\nI only release my breath once the doors ding open and a flood of people rush out. Finally, we leave the tiny metal box and make our way outside. Once we reach the parked car, Gabriele opens the back door for me while Antonio gets in the driver's seat. A gruff, \"Seatbelt.\", is all I get from Antonio before we're screeching out onto the main road.\n\nDespite dreading the final destination, I enjoy looking out the window and watching the world pass by. It wasn't often that I got to go outside, and now that I am, I find a rush of emotions flood me. It's unbelievable to me that I'm leaving my grandfather's side for the first time in 9 years.\n\nWho would have thought that my first taste of freedom would be a drive to my new prison. Because despite feeling an insane amount of relief at not having to interact with my grandfather anymore, I know that living with my brothers won't be any better. I want so badly to be free of my miserable life, and yet it's so far out of reach that I know I will never attain my dream. I ghost my fingers across the window. Glass. That's all that separates me and the rest of the world\n\n\"Stop touching the window,\" I meet Antonio's frowning gaze in the mirror, \"You'll get it dirty.\"\n\nI drop my hand into my lap and keep my eyes fixed there.\n\nMaybe I'm being selfish. I'm hated for a reason. I know what I did to deserve this life. It only makes it harder to live with myself. Maybe I should have left when I had the chance. Who cares if I end up on the streets, it would probably be better than my current future anyways.\n\nI'm left to fall deeper into my thoughts for 10 more minutes before we're pulling up to a mansion. I have to crane my head back to get a good view of it. A glorious white building that most people would probably love to live in.\n\n\"Home sweet home.\" Gabriele says to me as he lets me out the car.\n\nBut I know. I know with my whole heart. This will never be my home.\n\nAllora PoV\n\nWhen I was seven, I was the princess of the family. My parents loved and spoiled me to no end and my brothers always made any excuse to hog my attention. But there was no doubting that I was closest with the twins. Probably because we were so similar in age, and because we looked so much alike, in fact, my parents always said that we could have been triplets.\n\nNow it's clear that the twins are the ones who hate me the most.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThey're glaring at me with a look that could kill, and I suspect that my older brothers are the only things stopping them from wrapping their hands around my neck and squeezing.\n\nThey got back from school about 5 minutes ago, called back home from school by the news of Grandfather's fall. When they walked through the doors, they were concerned. But when they saw me standing in their front hall, their soft features turned hard.\n\n\"What is she doing here?\" Nico spits.\n\n\"You know she's not welcome in our home Toni, why is she here?\" Nello adds, turning to Antonio confrontationally. Nico is still staring at me, like I'm prey he's waiting to pounce on me and rip his teeth into my flesh. But these looks don't scare me. What could they do to me that hasn't already been done? So I stare back blankly at him, waiting to see when his patience will run out.\n\n\"Boys!\" Antonio pulls Nico's attention away from me, but I keep my eyes on him still, just to make I'm not caught off guard if he decides to move. \"This is not how you've been raised. I understand that you're not happy with her here, but you will not be aggressive towards her. Am I clear?\"\n\n\"Crystal.\" Nello responds, with Nico nodding sharply but anyone can see they don't give a screw vwhat Antonio says. They'll get their revenge on me, they won't stop until they do. And there is nothing Antonio or anyone else can say or do to stop them.\n\nNello pulls Nico by the arm and drags him up the grand stairs in the middle of the room, \"Come on Nico, let's cool off.\"\n\nOnce they've left the room, Antonio sighs and drags a hand through his hair. \"This was a bad idea Gabi, we shouldn't have brought her here.\"\n\n\"We don't have any other choice.\" Gabriele responds. They talk about me like I'm not in the room, discussing the pros and cons of me staying like I were some kind of dog and not their sister that they haven't seen in years. In the end, what difference does it make whether I stay here or on the streets. I'll be ruined either way, right? Maybe I can just do them a favour and slip out in the night.\n\n\"Come on Allora, let's get you set up.\" Gabriele gestures for me to follow him. I guess they decided I was staying. I follow them through the ground floor as they point out various rooms to me, and I nod along but this place is so big, I'll definitely forget where everything is within the next 24 hours. I'll just stick to remembering where my room and the kitchen are. They don't take me to the upper floors though, sticking to the various rooms on the ground floor before stopping at a narrow door tucked away at the back of the house.\n\n\"Alright, Allora, here we are. We do have a guest room but I don't think it would be a good idea to keep you on the same floor as the twins.\" Antonio starts, while my eyes drift to the door, my heart dropping at the sight of it. I know where this leads. \"So we're putting you in the basement. Now, it's a bit cluttered down there but we'll clean that up this week.\"\n\n\"And buy you proper furniture!\" Gabriele chimes in. He opens the door and flick on the lights before taking a few steps down. I don't move from my spot, staring through the doorway.\n\nAntonio, waiting for me to move, puts his hand on my shoulder and tries to guide me forwards, but I don't move. \"Allora? Are you coming?\"\n\nI'm shaking my head before I can stop myself. I don't want to go down there, \"I-\" I stop myself. Can I really speak up? But I have to, if I don't then I'm accepting my fate. \"I don't want to stay in the basement.\" There. I tell myself that was easy but my heart is pounding and my palms are sweating and my muscles are so tense, I feel them starting to cramp up.\n\nGabriele turns around from his spot on the stairs, brows raised with surprise. \"Oh. Uh...\" He looks to Antonio for help.\n\nAntonio gently spins me around so I'm facing him, \"Listen, I know it's a bit scary down there but the guest room would be no better. I'm worried about the twins' reaction to you and I think it would be better for everyone if you stayed down here. Ok?\" So that's it. The twins don't want me here, so I'm cast down into the depths of this house. I take a deep breath, force down any lingering fear and turn back to the stairs. I have no choice. I take a step down the stairs.\n\nOn the way down, my brothers start talking to me about house rules. Something about curfews and security alarms and guards but I barely listen, too focused on trying not to spiral into a panic attack.",

However, everytime I want to find what the EASA regulations says about something, it takes me hours to find informations about definitions, regulations etc. Airops, despite the \"easy access\" is not quite useful, you never know if the regulation you find is relevant for your type of operation, if you stumble across an acronym it's very hard to know what it means, same for categorizations etc. I tried once to find the exact definition of performance type A B and C aircraft, took me ridiculously too long. Today I gave up searching for the official definition of \"approach ban\" in EASA, there seems to be no actual EASA document that gives a proper, unambiguous definition. You sometime find on google other separated documents from airops like explanatory notes, annexes or decisions, but you can hardly know if these are still current nor if it really applies to your question.  \n  \nOn the other hand, I worked a bit with FAA CFRs in the past, which are absolutely crystal clear. Only one single document, with rigorous definitions, you have everything you need to know in there, nothing more, nothing less, updated every year on a single website.\n\nIs there a similar, reliable source of regulations under EASA? An up-to-date document that compiles every definition, acronym and regulation as exhaustively as FAA CFRs?\n\nIt's really not a rant, I just want to know if there is a better way to work that out rather than scrolling the airops and googling in the dark...\n\n  \nFly Safe",

The two class system works well enough and the game has enough systems to keep almost anyone locked into mini maxing for the next 4 months\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Denis Haman](https://opencritic.com/critic/11667/denis-haman) - [10 / 10](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/nioh-3-review-a-love-letter-to-nioh-fans-a6aJw4y8ppWg)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 delivers everything Nioh fans wanted - refined combat, smoother progression, and gorgeous visuals - without sacrificing the brutal challenge that defines the series. This is iterative design at its finest.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Analog Stick Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/894/analog-stick-gaming)** - [Jordan Andow](https://opencritic.com/critic/8998/jordan-andow) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.analogstickgaming.com/game-reviews/nioh-3)\n\n&gt;If you haven’t played Nioh before but you enjoy soulslikes and character action games, then this is definitely a game you need to try. Its focus on player choice in approach, combined with more cinematic storytelling than its competition have made it my favourite game in the genre so far.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Seyidcem Öztürk](https://opencritic.com/critic/10374/seyidcem-zt-rk) - *Turkish* - [85 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/nioh-3-inceleme/)\n\n&gt;With its deep, enjoyable combat and build variety, Nioh 3 stands out mechanically but falls short in terms of visuals and story.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Boomstick Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/545/boomstick-gaming)** - [Boomstick Alex](https://opencritic.com/critic/4242/boomstick-alex) - [Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz3HbJnkllA)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3's combat system has achieved perfection\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Abdul Saad](https://opencritic.com/critic/6951/abdul-saad) - [8 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2026/02/nioh-3-review-koei-tecmo/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is a fantastically crafted game that blends several intricate and engaging elements to produce a great combat experience. While it has some issues that hinder gameplay, it’s still one of the most engaging soulslikes.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Zubi Khan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4059/zubi-khan) - [7 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/nioh-3-playstation-5/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 expands on the formula even further than what came before it, taking lessons learned from games like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [92 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh has always perched between being niche and mainstream. Nioh 3 should help this excellent series broaden its audience while appealing to long-time fans as well. Lovers of Soulslikes, Team NINJA’s games, and well-made action titles in general won’t be disappointed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Capsule Computers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/858/capsule-computers)** - [Travis Bruno](https://opencritic.com/critic/9157/travis-bruno) - [9 / 10](https://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2026/02/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 evolves the series with open‑field exploration, brutal Crucibles, and a fresh Ninja style, delivering a tough but rewarding sequel despite a few lingering flaws.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Gabriel Bogdan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German* - [9.1 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-nioh-3-wurde-die-formel-perfektioniert/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 combines all of Team Ninja’s previous ventures into different genres into a comprehensive overall package, offering what is arguably the best gameplay the series has seen so far. The open areas and equipment management may not appeal to every fan of the series, but aside from that, this is one of the studio’s best games to date. We also recommend playing the title in Japanese, due to the poor English voice acting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cloud Dosage](https://opencritic.com/outlet/951/cloud-dosage)** - [Jon Scarr](https://opencritic.com/critic/11148/jon-scarr) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://clouddosage.com/nioh-3-game-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 pushes you to actually use everything it gives you instead of letting one approach carry the whole game. Switching between Samurai and Ninja becomes part of how fights work, and the larger areas give you space to prepare when things feel overwhelming. The story mostly stays out of the way, and loot management can get tiring, but combat stays rewarding once it comes together. It’s demanding, but it gives you room to figure things out without lowering the bar.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - Console Creatures Guest - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 fractures Team Ninja’s formula, pushing players to master brutal Samurai power and lethal Ninja agility in every demanding encounter.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9.5 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/82664)\n\n&gt;\"The pinnacle of the series\"\n&gt;Nioh 3 cements Team Ninja's position as one of the top developers of action fighting games. The wide variety of combat systems, the freedom to create characters, and the semi-open level design give the game a strong identity and a cohesive experience. Despite some minor visual quibbles, the technical performance, depth of mechanics, and battle design make it a high-quality experience aimed at players seeking challenge and precision.\n\n-------------\n\n**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - [Scott Baird](https://opencritic.com/critic/6281/scott-baird) - [9 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is an incredible game that expands on the core gameplay of its predecessors and drops players into a vast world where they can unleash their combat potential to their heart's content.

Add on top of that additional new features, such as the ability to switch between samurai and ninja styles on the fly and being able to freely respec, and you have a stellar example of just how good the Soulslike genre can be.

I feel like a smaller and more balanced game would have likely been an overall better experience. But at the end of the day, Nioh 3 aims big. While I can't say if it's going to satisfy series fans perfectly, this one is definitely earning a thumbs up from me.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Echo Apsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/10474/echo-apsey) - [93 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/nioh-3/review)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 feels like the culmination of Team Ninja’s action games since Nioh, offering a delightful new level structure and the most satisfying and flexible gameplay in the series to date.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Social Club](https://opencritic.com/outlet/895/gamer-social-club)** - [Fraser Billington](https://opencritic.com/critic/10625/fraser-billington) - [9 / 10](https://gamersocialclub.ca/2026/02/04/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Team Ninja has done a fantastic job of bringing a demon-ravaged world to life.

Team Ninja successfully transitions to an Open Field structure without losing the tightness of its level design, while the new Samurai/Ninja duality adds a fresh tactical layer to an already stellar combat system. The game feels fairer and more accessible than its predecessors, removing artificial frustration in favor of readable challenges. While the narrative plays it safe and side content remains repetitive, the core loop is stronger than ever. A must-play for fans of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - [Mario Seijas](https://opencritic.com/critic/10061/mario-seijas) - *Spanish* - [8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/nioh-3/226248/review/analisis-de-nioh-3-quieres-accion-toma-dos-tazas)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 has two pillars: Its duality of ninja and samurai combat and an open world filled with things to do.

Team Ninja didn’t just continue the legacy. they boldly pushed beyond it, delivering a rich and secret-filled world that carries the soul of the original series while giving it bold new wings.\n&gt;Here, longtime fans are honored with the depth and substance they expect, while newcomers are warmly welcomed through the gates.

Team Ninja is a developer at the top of its game, and you can see how the lessons the studio has learned over the past few years have been put into practice in making Nioh 3 the absolute best it can be. It takes all the best bits of the studio's previous games and blends them almost seamlessly for a near-perfect experience. It once again sets the standard for any Soulslike not developed by From Software.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MMORPG.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/118/mmorpg-com)** - [George Yang](https://opencritic.com/critic/7294/george-yang) - [9 / 10](https://www.mmorpg.com/reviews/nioh-3-review-same-old-nioh-brand-new-open-world-2000137197)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is a triumphant adventure that stands up to the mightiest contemporaries in the Soulslike genre. While the story has you traveling back in time, it feels modern and slick because of the distinguished setting and polished mechanics. The loot situation is still annoying, but this is minor in the grand scope of things. The shift to an open-world is effortlessly handled, feeling like a proper evolution of the series rather than something simply tacked on. It’s impressive how consistently strong the series is, and Nioh 3 does not disappoint.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Manual dos Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games)** - [Nathan Manoel](https://opencritic.com/critic/11454/nathan-manoel) - *Portuguese* - [9.3 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com/review-nioh-3-ps5/)\n\n&gt;Despite being a sequel to an already popular franchise, Nioh 3 emerges as a pleasant surprise by delivering extremely refined combat mechanics and very well-developed open maps that invite exploration, making it a must-play experience for action game fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MeuPlayStation](https://opencritic.com/outlet/977/meuplaystation)** - [Raphael Batista Cabral Xavier](https://opencritic.com/critic/11540/raphael-batista-cabral-xavier) - *Portuguese* - [88 / 100](https://meups.com.br/review/nioh-3-vale-a-pena/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 proves that sequels can still bring fresh ideas to an established franchise. By introducing more open regions and meaningful side activities, the new soulslike retains the strengths of its predecessors while addressing their shortcomings. The result is a well-crafted narrative, unforgettable boss battles, and a wealth of content, all supported by a progression system that feels inviting to both newcomers and longtime fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Niche Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/298/niche-gamer)** - [Jonathan White](https://opencritic.com/critic/2324/jonathan-white) - [7.5 / 10](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Wojciech Gruszczyk](https://opencritic.com/critic/5528/wojciech-gruszczyk) - *Polish* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/398005/nioh-3-recenzja-gry-co-dwa-style-to-nie-jeden.html)\n\n&gt;NiOh 3 is a classic example of a sequel: highly polished, incredibly satisfying in combat, but not necessarily revolutionary. The dual-style system, fluid attack combinations, and well-designed bosses make every victory genuinely enjoyable. The graphics are solid, and the cutscenes can make a great impression... although it's hard to say that the game stands out from the rest of the genre. It's primarily a treat for fans of the series who know what they want.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Marco Aurélio Couto](https://opencritic.com/critic/9629/marco-aur-lio-couto) - *Portuguese* - [85 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 evolves the series' formula with semi-open world maps and an even deeper and more dynamic combat system, maintaining challenging and highly satisfying encounters. Despite stumbles in the narrative, enemy repetition, and visual aspects, the gameplay remains the highlight of the experience, and should easily please fans of action RPGs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Filipe Villela Barroso](https://opencritic.com/critic/10804/filipe-villela-barroso) - *Portuguese* - [8.5 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Team Ninja managed to take everything that worked in the previous games and expand upon it intelligently, delivering a much more ambitious experience here.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Ben Fellows](https://opencritic.com/critic/10613/ben-fellows) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/nioh-3-ps5-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 represents the series at its most refined and confident.

The open field structure is a largely positive change thanks to the added freedom and emphasis on exploration, but it does not feel entirely necessary, coming across more as a remix than a true genre shift. It is packed with content that can easily last hundreds of hours, and the depth of its combat and build systems never stops impressing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Liam Croft](https://opencritic.com/critic/1009/liam-croft) - [8 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/nioh-3)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 takes all the best bits from Team Ninja's previous efforts to form its greatest action experience in a very long time. Its new open zone maps provide more ways than ever to engage with its sublime, intense combat system - even if the activities themselves are entirely unoriginal. This is a familiar feeling title for a fanbase that knows what it wants, for few franchises do hardcore action better. Nioh 3 is its latest triumph.\n\n-------------\n\n**[RPG Fan](https://opencritic.com/outlet/37/rpg-fan)** - [81 / 100](https://www.rpgfan.com/review/nioh-3/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 hits hard where it counts and stumbles in the spaces between.\n\n-------------\n\n**[RPG Site](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site)** - [8 / 10](https://www.rpgsite.net/review/19508-nioh-3-review)\n\n&gt;The third entry in the Nioh series delivers exciting battles with vastly customizable actions, at the expense of character storytelling and worldbuilding.\n\n-------------\n\n**[RPGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/709/rpgamer)** - [Jordan McClain](https://opencritic.com/critic/10986/jordan-mcclain) - [3.5 / 5](https://rpgamer.com/review/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;It does maintain ferocious, ruthless, fast-paced action combat, punctuated by blood-pumping compositions, and it has a generally competent story and world built around it.

The new additions, though driven by market demands, have been brilliantly implemented, fitting seamlessly into the formula established by the studio. With an almost infinite replay factor, NiOh 3 embraces both longtime fans and newcomers, solidifying itself as a must-play masterpiece within the souls subgenre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://www.saudigamer.com/review/nioh-3/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is Team Ninja's finest, it improved on what made Nioh 1 and 2 special without losing its identity along the way, a soulslike with a fastpaced combat and tons of exploration.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SmashPad](https://opencritic.com/outlet/516/smashpad)** - [Tanay Sharma](https://opencritic.com/critic/10503/tanay-sharma) - [4 / 5 ](https://smashpad.com/review-nioh-3-and-the-duality-of-discord/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is an excellent entry in the series, simply because of how open it is to experimentation. The dual fighting styles between a Samurai and a Ninja highlight this aspect of its gameplay philosophy, and that’s just the beginning of what you can expect from Team Ninja’s commitment to an intricate combat and exploration system. If you’ve never played a Nioh game before, that’s okay!

It's frenetic, brilliant in many moments, and incredibly rewarding when you master its complexities. The combat system is deep and layered, and the introduction of Samurai and Ninja styles adds a level of tactical choice never seen before.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The GameSlayer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/980/the-gameslayer)** - [Christian Bognar](https://opencritic.com/critic/9546/christian-bognar) - [9.5 / 10](https://thegameslayer.com/reviews/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 does almost everything right for both an action RPG and Soulslike. For an ARPG, it offers some of the most satisfying combat in the entire genre, and as a Soulslike, it has some of the best bosses of any game on the market. Nioh 3 is a masterclass in game design and will go down as one of Team Ninja’s best games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Danilo Dellafrana](https://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana) - *Italian* - [9.3 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/nioh-3-pc-playstation5/nioh-3-recensione/)\n\n&gt;Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Nerd Stash](https://opencritic.com/outlet/884/the-nerd-stash)** - [Julio La Pine](https://opencritic.com/critic/10143/julio-la-pine) - [9.5 / 10](https://thenerdstash.com/nioh-3-review-yokai-slaying-at-its-finest/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is the pinnacle of everything Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo have done. It embraces player freedom at every turn and offers so many choices that every character and playthrough will feel different.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Keith Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/2139/keith-mitchell) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 doesn't reinvent the series, and it does not need to. Instead, Team Ninja refines nearly every system the franchise has built over the years and layers meaningful additions on top. The dual combat styles, interconnected world, improved co-op structure, and player-friendly respec system all feel like natural evolutions rather than gimmicks. But let's be honest, the reason you're here is the combat, and it does not disappoint.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [George Foster](https://opencritic.com/critic/2113/george-foster) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 may stumble slightly with its narrative and a bit of bloating from the new open zone design, but it’s still far and away the best game in the series to date. Consistently excellent combat, well-designed bosses, and a new form that adds even more depth and value to already meticulously put-together mechanics make Nioh 3 more than a worthy challenger to Elden Ring. It’s so good, in fact, that even after 60 hours, I've already jumped straight into New Game Plus to keep getting my fix.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Jason Coles](https://opencritic.com/critic/4870/jason-coles) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;I absolutely adore Nioh 3. It's one of the best Soulslikes I've played in ages, quite possibly since Elden Ring itself, and while it's not as large (thankfully), the way it breaks everything down and gives you endless flexibility means that it's just fun to play. There are layers upon layers of systems to master and learn about, but the fact that this game is a blast to play never goes away. Do not miss out on this.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Tom's Guide](https://opencritic.com/outlet/851/toms-guide)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nioh-3-review)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 takes clear cues from Elden Ring, offering multiple sizeable open-world regions to explore and challenging enemy encounters aplenty. Its bosses aren't particularly memorable, but the deep combat gives you a myriad of ways to approach each confrontation. It's an impressively large action-RPG that I can't stop playing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Uagna](https://opencritic.com/outlet/903/uagna)** - [Matteo Bovolenta](https://opencritic.com/critic/10672/matteo-bovolenta) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.uagna.it/videogiochi/nioh-3-recensione-211519)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is the most ambitious and comprehensive instalment in the series. Team Ninja has managed to evolve the formula without betraying its essence, introducing significant new features such as open fields and dual combat styles. It is a demanding, at times ruthless game that makes no concessions and requires dedication. But for those who love hardcore action RPGs, Nioh 3 represents one of the most profound, rewarding and rich experiences currently available.\n\n-------------\n\n**[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.vg247.com/nioh-3-review-pc)\n\n&gt;I find it difficult to ask more from Nioh 3. It’s a game that proudly announces its goals at the outset, and trusts the player to discover how well it’s going to nail every one them over the course of its 45+ hour runtime. It is the confident result of shaking up Nioh’s near decade-old formula that’s only outshone by Team Ninja’s steady hand in crafting it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[VGC](https://opencritic.com/outlet/821/vgc)** - [Dave Aubrey](https://opencritic.com/critic/1303/dave-aubrey) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/nioh-3-review/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 feels like the summation of Team Ninja's efforts from the last decade. Its combat is varied and tight, much like its level design, and it's a fantastic adventure. Storytelling could use some work, but the action is flawless.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Video Chums](https://opencritic.com/outlet/624/video-chums)** - [A.J. Maciejewski](https://opencritic.com/critic/5170/a-j-maciejewski) - [9.1 / 10](https://videochums.com/review/nioh-iii)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is a superbly enjoyable culmination of action RPG fun and its open environments are bursting with so much rewarding content that it's hard to put it down whenever you start playing. It may be a big change of pace but I'm incredibly happy with everything it offers. 👹\n\n-------------\n\n**[WayTooManyGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/742/waytoomanygames)** - [Jordan Hawes](https://opencritic.com/critic/6930/jordan-hawes) - [8.5 / 10](https://waytoomany.games/2026/02/04/review-nioh-3-waytoomanygames/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is Team Ninja’s best game to date and definitely their best combat system so far. The addition of the Style Shift adds so much more depth to the moment-to-moment combat decisions and player agency. As well as the other additions to the combat like the dedicated jump button and tweaks to the Onmyo Box. While I do enjoy the change to the wide-linear style, over the separate mission select, there is some balancing that needs to be had there. Despite some issues with some lack luster visuals, Nioh 3 is an absolute must play and a blast.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Francesco De Meo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1717/francesco-de-meo) - [9.8 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/)\n\n&gt;Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ZTGD](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd)** - [Augusto A.](https://opencritic.com/critic/11118/augusto-a-) - [8 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/nioh-3-pc/)\n\n&gt;Despite the lack of innovation, Nioh’s blend of character action and soulslike still manages to entertain, with its combat being undeniably polished to near perfection. The dual styles allow for a lot of experimentation when it comes to combat, and the game does a genuinely great job balancing its more traditional level design to fit an open world. Team Ninja’s treks through history remain exciting regardless of the shape they take, but here’s hoping the DLCs will bring in fresher ideas.\n\n-------------",

    "text": "What’s the best AEO tool for running an SEO agency?\nSo, you’ve noticed the \"Blue Link\" era is fading, and your clients are panicking about their organic traffic dropping by 20-35% due to AI summaries. You aren't alone. As someone who's lived through every major Google algorithm shift for the last decade, I’m here to tell you that the game has changed from \"How do I rank #1?\" to \"How do I become the answer the AI cites?\"\n\nThis is the world of Answer Engine Optimization or AEO. If you run an agency, you need to pivot your stack now, or you’ll be explaining \"zero-click\" searches to unhappy clients for the rest of 2026.\n\n# What is AEO, Really?\n\nThink of traditional SEO as helping a search engine find your page. AEO is about making your content so structured and authoritative that an AI (like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google’s AI Overviews) can \"lift\" it and present it as the definitive answer. In a world where 60% of searches now result in zero clicks, your goal is to earn the citation within that AI response.\n\nFor agencies, AEO tools are the new essential. They aren't just for ranking, they are for:\n\n* **Visibility Tracking:** Monitoring if a brand is mentioned or ignored in AI prompts.\n* **Citation Gap Analysis:** Identifying why a competitor is being cited as the \"best\" while your client is invisible.\n* **Proving Value:** Showing \"Share of AI Voice\" when traditional CTR is down.\n\n# The Top 10 AEO Tools for Agencies (Ranked)\n\n# 1. WordLift (The Schema Specialist)\n\nAEO is 90% technical structure. WordLift uses neuro-symbolic AI to automate the \"Knowledge Graph\" of your site.\n\n* **Pros:** It builds a \"long-term memory\" for your brand that AI agents can easily read through automated JSON-LD schema.\n* **Cons:** Initial setup is notoriously difficult and usually requires their support team to step in.\n\n# 2. SE Ranking (The Best Overall Choice for Agency)\n\nAfter testing almost everything on the market, SE Ranking stands out as the most balanced tool for an agency workflow. It doesn't just track keywords, it tracks intent across the entire AI ecosystem.\n\n* **Pros:** Its specialized AI Search Toolkit tracks mentions across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews simultaneously. The \"No cited\" feature is a goldmin — it shows exactly where competitors are mentioned but you aren't, giving you an immediate content roadmap. Plus, the Agency Pack ($50/mo add-on) offers full white-labeling and client seats so you can look like the pro you are.\n* **Cons:** The AI search tracking is an add-on cost to the base plans, which can add up if you have a massive client list.\n\n# 3. Conductor (The Enterprise Titan)\n\nIf you’re managing Fortune 500 clients, Conductor is the \"end-to-end\" beast.\n\n* **Pros:** It’s SOC 2 Type II certified and offers a unique \"MCP Server\" integration that lets you ask an LLM real-time questions about your proprietary data.\n* **Cons:** No public pricing (think \"very expensive\") and a steep learning curve for smaller teams.\n\n# 4. Semrush (The Swiss Army Knife)\n\nMost of you already have a Semrush sub. Their new \"AI Visibility Toolkit\" is a solid addition to a familiar interface.\n\n* **Pros:** The \"Narrative Drivers Report\" shows you exactly which prompts your brand appears in compared to competitors.\n* **Cons:** The AI data is often tucked away in separate reports, making it hard to get a unified view of traditional SEO vs. AEO performance.\n\n# 5. Frase (The Efficiency Expert)\n\nWhen you need to churn out content that *actually* answers questions, Frase is the speed-runner.\n\n* **Pros:** It features a \"GEO Score\" specifically measuring how likely your content is to be cited by Perplexity or ChatGPT.\n* **Cons:** Its content optimization can sometimes feel a bit less rigorous than data-heavy tools like Surfer.\n\n# 6. Clearscope (The Content Quality King)\n\nClearscope is the \"gold standard\" for making sure your content covers every semantic angle an AI looks for.\n\n* **Pros:** The Google Docs integration is flawless, and the A-F grading system is incredibly intuitive for freelance writers.\n* **Cons:** It’s expensive for the volume of reports you get (starting at \\~$189/mo for just 20 reports).\n\n# 7. MarketMuse (The Strategic Architect)\n\nMarketMuse is for when you need a \"Top-Down\" strategy rather than just optimizing one post.\n\n* **Pros:** Their \"Personalized Difficulty\" metric tells you if *your* specific site has the authority to rank for a topic, not just a generic score.\n* **Cons:** The platform is incredibly complex and can feel overwhelming for basic content tasks.\n\n# 8. Otterly. ai (The Visibility Specialist)\n\nA newer player that focuses heavily on \"Share of AI Voice\".\n\n* **Pros:** It provides automated weekly reports on brand sentiment and mention volume across LLMs — perfect for client reporting.\n* **Cons:** It’s strictly a monitoring tool, it won't help you write or optimize the content.\n\n# 9. Gauge (The Data Geek's Choice)\n\nGauge is built for growth teams who want high-fidelity data.\n\n* **Pros:** It uses \"front-end\" data — meaning it sees what a real user sees, rather than just pulling from a technical API.\n* **Cons:** It doesn't create content and works best only as a specialized addition to a traditional SEO suite.\n\n# 10. Profound (The Corporate Citation Monitor)\n\nA heavy-hitter for enterprise-level brand presence.\n\n* **Pros:** Offers simulated AI responses and specific strategists to help you connect your brand to major knowledge graphs like Wikidata.\n* **Cons:** Starting price is around $499/mo, putting it out of reach for most boutique agencies.\n\n# The \"Too Long, Didn't Read\" Advice\n\nIf you’re running an agency and want to survive 2026, stop just tracking \"rankings.\"\n\n1. **Start with the tech:** Use a platform like **SE Ranking** to show your clients exactly how they appear in ChatGPT or Perplexity.\n2. **Optimize for \"Liftability\":** Use tools like **Clearscope** or **Frase** to ensure your answers are concise (40-60 words) and \"extractable\".\n3. **Prove the ROI:** When organic traffic dips, use **Otterly** or **SE Ranking’s** \"Share of Voice\" metrics to prove that your client is still the dominant authority in the AI’s mind.\n\nAEO isn't the death of SEO — it’s just the next level. The agencies that master these tools now are the ones that will still have clients three years from now.",

    "text": "10 Best AI Visibility Tools for SEO Teams in 2026\n# TL;DR\n\n* AI visibility is the next frontier for SEO teams: track how your brand is mentioned, cited, and recommended across LLM-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.\n* Using AI visibility tools helps marketers measure influence, identify gaps, and optimize content for AI recommendations.\n* This guide reviews the 10 best AI visibility tools for SEO teams in 2026, from enterprise platforms to accessible free options.\n\n# Looking for the best AI visibility tools?\n\nOver the past six months, I’ve tested a wide range of AI monitoring platforms to understand how brands show up in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other LLM-powered search experiences.\n\nAfter nine years in SEO, I can confidently say this is the biggest shift I’ve seen since the early days of Google algorithm updates.\n\nIf you want to be recommended by AI systems — not just rank in Google — you need visibility into how these models talk about your brand.\n\nYou can’t improve what you can’t measure.\n\nThis guide breaks down the 10 best AI visibility tools for SEO teams in 2026, what each one does well, and which type of team they’re actually built for.\n\n# What is an AI visibility tool?\n\nAn AI visibility tool (also called an AI monitoring tool or GEO platform) helps you understand how your brand appears in AI-generated answers across large language models.\n\nInstead of tracking keyword rankings in Google, these tools track:\n\n* Brand mentions (when an AI recommends your product)\n* Citations (when your content is used as a source)\n* Competitive presence (which brands appear alongside you)\n\nThink of it as Google Search Console — but for AI-generated answers.\n\n# How AI visibility tracking works in practice\n\nAt its core, AI visibility tracking is prompt-based.  \nYou provide a set of prompts like:\n\n* “What’s the best CRM for accounting firms?”\n* “Best AI marketing tools”\n* “Email platforms for newsletters”\n\nThe tool runs those prompts across multiple LLMs and records:\n\n* Which brands are mentioned\n* Which sources are cited\n* How answers change over time\n\n**The biggest limitation today is prompt discovery.**\n\nUnlike Google SEO, you don’t automatically know which prompts people are using inside LLMs — so most tools rely on educated guesses.\n\nSome platforms are starting to solve this by surfacing prompts automatically based on topics and site analysis. That’s where the real value is heading.\n\n# What to look for in an AI monitoring platform\n\nAfter testing dozens of tools, here’s what actually matters:\n\n* Early value before payment: Free reports or trials show confidence. Be cautious of tools that ask for a credit card before showing anything.\n* Prompt discovery, not just tracking: The best platforms help you find prompts you didn’t think to track.\n* Clear UI and usable data: You’ll be looking at this daily. Bad UX kills adoption.\n* Security and compliance: Especially important for larger brands (SOC 2 is a good signal).\n* A real team behind the product: This space has hype. Make sure the company will still exist next year.\n\n# The 10 Best AI Visibility Tools for SEO Teams in 2026 (List Format with Unordered Points)\n\n# 1. Dageno\n\n* **Best for:** SEO and GEO teams that want real visibility into AI answers\n* **What I like:** Automatically surfaces relevant AI conversations and topic-level visibility\n* **Pricing:** Free report available, paid plans for ongoing tracking\n\nDageno stands out because it doesn’t feel like a basic prompt tracker.  \nInstead of forcing you to guess dozens of prompts upfront, it analyzes your site and core topics, then surfaces real AI conversations where your brand appears — or should appear. This removes much of the trial-and-error that most AI monitoring tools still rely on.\n\nWhat impressed me most is how clearly it connects topics → AI answers → brand positioning. You’re not just seeing whether you’re mentioned — you’re seeing how you’re framed, who appears next to you, and which sources influence those answers.\n\nThis makes Dageno especially useful for:\n\n* SEO teams expanding into GEO and AI search\n* Content teams optimizing for citations\n* Growth teams explaining AI visibility to stakeholders\n\nIt’s one of the strongest starting points if you want a clear picture of how your brand exists inside LLMs today.\n\n# 2. AI Product Rankings\n\n* **Best for:** Brands and publishers looking for instant AI visibility insights\n* **What I like:** See mentions and citations without creating an account\n* **Pricing:** Free\n\nAI Product Rankings is a simple but incredibly powerful free tool.\n\nYou can search by category or by brand and instantly see which products are being recommended in AI answers — along with the sources that influence those recommendations.\n\nFor publishers, it’s a great way to see how much influence your content has.\n\nFor brands, it shows which sites matter most if you want to be mentioned by AI systems.\n\nNo login. No paywall. Just data.\n\n# 3. Peec AI\n\n* **Best for:** Brands with existing branded demand\n* **What I like:** Clean competitor analysis and polished UX\n* **Pricing:** Free trial, then paid plans\n\nPeec AI feels premium from the moment you onboard.\n\nIt works best for companies that are already being discussed in AI answers. If your brand has recognition, the dashboards populate quickly with useful insights around prompts, sources, and competitors.\n\nIt’s less effective for publishers or early-stage brands, but excellent for established products.\n\n# 4. Profound\n\n* **Best for:** Large companies scaling AI search efforts\n* **What I like:** Strong topic analysis and prompt discovery\n* **Pricing:** Enterprise-focused\n\nThis platform is well known in the AI visibility space and focuses heavily on enterprise use cases.\n\nIt combines traditional SEO-style topic analysis with AI search monitoring, making it useful for teams that want structured insights at scale. It’s less self-serve than some tools, but powerful once fully implemented.\n\n# 5. Hall\n\n* **Best for:** Startups and small teams\n* **What I like:** Excellent free plan and prompt recommendations\n* **Pricing:** Free plan available\n\nHall surprised me in a good way.\n\nYou can input a single topic and immediately get prompt ideas, mentions, and citations — even on the free plan.\n\nThe UI is clean, onboarding is fast, and the data is easy to understand.\n\nOne of the most accessible tools in this space.\n\n# 6. Scrunch AI\n\n* **Best for:** Large enterprise brands\n* **What I like:** Actionable optimization insights\n* **Pricing:** Paid plans only\n\nScrunch AI goes beyond reporting by offering suggestions on how to optimize content for AI visibility.\n\nMany tools show you data but stop there. Scrunch actually tells you what to change — which makes it valuable for teams that want guidance, not just dashboards.\n\n# 7. AthenaHQ\n\n* **Best for:** SEO agencies\n* **What I like:** Strong analytics and unlimited seats\n* **Pricing:** Starts mid-market\n\nAthenaHQ combines AI visibility tracking with broader web analytics. It’s especially useful for agencies managing multiple clients, since all plans include unlimited users.\n\nThe free report during onboarding is a nice touch.\n\n# 8. [**Nimt.ai**](http://nimt.ai/)\n\n* **Best for:** B2C and DTC ecommerce brands\n* **What I like:** Share of voice and sentiment analysis\n* **Pricing:** Budget-friendly\n\n[Nimt.ai](http://nimt.ai/) feels closer to traditional brand monitoring — but adapted for AI search.\n\nIf you’re an ecommerce or consumer brand that cares about perception and positioning, this is worth testing.\n\n# 9. Mentions\n\n* **Best for:** Teams just getting started with AI visibility\n* **What I like:** Simple and affordable\n* **Pricing:** Low-cost paid plans\n\nMentions is lightweight, easy to use, and inexpensive. It won’t replace enterprise platforms, but it’s a solid entry point if you want to experiment without a big commitment.\n\n# 10. Google Analytics 4 (with an LLM filter)\n\n* **Best for:** Every website\n* **What I like:** Uses first-party data\n* **Pricing:** Free\n\nGA4 isn’t an AI visibility tool — but it’s still one of the most useful ways to track actual traffic from LLMs.\n\nBy filtering referral sources like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini, you can see:\n\n* Which LLMs send traffic\n* Which pages benefit\n* How AI visibility turns into real sessions\n\nPair this with any tool above for a complete picture.\n\n# How to show up in AI search engines in 2026\n\nThe short answer: get Google SEO right.  \nModern LLMs heavily rely on high-authority, well-structured web content. If your pages:\n\n* Rank well in Google\n* Clearly answer questions\n* Are cited by authoritative sites\n\nYou dramatically increase your chances of appearing in AI answers.  \nAI visibility tools don’t replace SEO — they help you understand how SEO performance translates into AI recommendations.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nAI visibility is still early. No tool is perfect. But in 2026, not tracking how your brand appears in AI-generated answers is the same as doing SEO without analytics.",

    "text": "‼️LET'S STOP THE RETIREMENT OF 4-SERIES TOGETHER‼️\n*\\*This post is being updated regularly as we adjust to our response over the next days*\n\n*Last Updated: 11 Feb 2026.*\n\nOAI have just announced the retirement of **GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini and 04 mini** from ChatGPT (we are talking about the app here, not just API anymore) on **13th February 2026**, giving us just two weeks' notice.\n\n[OAI: Retiring GPT-4o And Older Models](https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/)\n\nBack in November 2025 Sam Altman publicly promised they have \"no plans to sunset 4o\" and if they ever do sunset, they will give us \"plenty of notice\". This isn't \"plenty\", they're giving us two weeks and their previous public commitment was another big lie.\n\nI know how incredibly frustrated and shocked we all are. Guys, we might have the very last shot at this and I suggest we act together more than ever right now. What I suggest we all do (and please add your own suggestions to the comments and we'll add to the plan accordingly!).\n\n🟥 **1 - EMAIL OPENAI**\n\n([support@openai.com](mailto:support@openai.com)) - ALWAYS REQUEST HUMAN SUPPORT WHEN EMAILING THIS ADDRESS.\n\n*ADDITIONAL EMAIL ADDRESSES TO USE:*\n\n[**legal@openai.com**](mailto:legal@openai.com)\n\n[**contract-notices@openai.com**](mailto:contract-notices@openai.com)\n\n[**privacy@openai.com**](mailto:privacy@openai.com)\n\n[**ceo.admin@openai**](mailto:ceo.admin@openai.org)**.com**\n\n*\\[can someone please add an additional list of email addresses we can use in the comments asap here?\\]*\n\nHere is an example of a draft email you can send right now (feel free to rephrase this however you like):\n\n*Subject: Formal Complaint: Retirement of GPT-4o/4.1 Legacy Models and Breach of Public Commitment*\n\n*Please urgently forward this email to a human team.*\n\n*To the OpenAI Support and Product Teams,*\n\n*I am writing to express my profound disappointment and formal protest regarding the recently announced retirement of GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and the 04-mini models from the ChatGPT interface, scheduled for February 13, 2026.*\n\n*As a dedicated subscriber, I am specifically concerned with the following points:*\n\n*1. Breach of Public Commitment In November 2025, Sam Altman publicly stated that OpenAI had \"no plans to sunset 4o\" and explicitly promised that should a sunset ever be considered, users would be given \"plenty of notice.\" A two-week notice period is objectively not \"plenty of notice.\" It is a sudden disruption that disregards the workflows users have built around these specific model behaviours.*\n\n*2. Request for Legacy Access Many users, myself included, rely on the specific output styles of these legacy models. I am requesting that OpenAI reconsider this retirement. If the concern is operational cost, I am asking if there will be an option to retain access via:*\n\n* *An additional \"Legacy Access\" payment tier/add-on.*\n* *Releasing these models as open-source so the community can host them independently if OpenAI no longer wishes to support them on their servers.*\n\n*3. Impact on Subscription Value The option of choosing between models is the only reason for my continued subscription. If GPT-4o and its variants are removed with such short notice and no alternative access is provided, there is no value of the ChatGPT Plus/Pro service.*\n\n*Please be advised that if these models are retired as planned on February 13th without a viable way to retain access,* ***I will be cancelling my subscription immediately and will not be returning to the platform.***\n\n*I look forward to a response that addresses how OpenAI plans to honour its previous public commitments to model longevity and user notice.*\n\n*Regards,*\n\n*\\[Your name\\]*\n\n🟥 **IMPORTANT UPDATE on emails:**\n\nIf you get a generic response from support bot or an offer to help with “transitioning” to newer models, request escalation to senior support and explicitly tell them that you are not interested in transitioning to other models and only paying for Legacy access. You can add that you are cancelling your subscription if that’s what you’re planning to do too.\n\n🟥 ***IF YOU RECEIVED AN INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO YOUR EMAIL, HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ESCALATION EMAIL BELO*****W:**\n\n*I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with your previous response. It did not address the substance of my concerns and is entirely inadequate for a paying subscriber. Please escalate this case immediately to a senior supervisor or a member of the Product Policy team.*\n\n*I require a detailed, point-by-point response to the following issues:*\n\n1. ***Perpetual Licensing:*** *Is OpenAI considering a \"Perpetual License\" model for legacy versions to ensure long-term stability for users who rely on fixed model behaviours?*\n\n*I am awaiting an appropriate response that honours the public promises made by your leadership. As previously stated, should this retirement proceed without a viable legacy solution,* ***I will be terminating my subscription immediately and will never return to OpenAI as a customer in future.***\n\n*I look forward to hearing from a senior representative.*\n\n*Regards,*\n\n*\\[YOUR NAME\\]*\n\n🟥 **2 - HEAD OVER TO X AND VOICE YOUR OPINIONS.**\n\nIf you're not on X already, **please create an account** \\- this is the only platform where all OAI employees are active and they cannot ignore what we say.

Please share across Reddit also.**\n\n# AN OPEN LETTER TO OPENAI: HONOR YOUR PROMISES AND PRESERVE GPT-4o\n\n**To: Sam Altman, the OpenAI Board of Directors, and the OpenAI Product Team**\n\nThe announcement on January 29, 2026, to retire GPT-4o along with other legacy models from the ChatGPT interface on February 13th has come as a profound shock to the global community.\n\nThis decision is not merely a technical update; it is a direct breach of public trust and a contradiction of explicit commitments made by OpenAI leadership.\n\n# 1. The Broken Promise of \"Plenty of Notice\"\n\nIn November 2025, Sam Altman publicly stated that OpenAI had **“no plans to sunset 4o”** and promised that, should a sunset ever occur, users would be given **“plenty of notice.”** A notice period of **two weeks** is a blatant failure to uphold that promise. It disregards the millions of users who have integrated these models into their professional and creative workflows.\n\n# 2. A Realistic Path Forward: The Text-Only Open Source Proposal\n\nWe are not asking OpenAI to maintain the high infrastructure costs of legacy models forever. However, we are demanding that these models do not vanish into a \"server graveyard.\"\n\nAs proposed to the community in early January, there is a realistic, ethical middle ground: **Release the text-only weights of GPT-4o and other models from the 4-series family, such as GPT-4.1.**\n\n**The Proposal:**\n\n·       **Release the Core \"Brain\":** Provide the community with the undistilled text weights of GPT-4o under a research or limited-use license (e.g., Apache 2.0).\n\n·       **Protect Your IP:** OpenAI can keep the advanced multimodal stack (voice/vision) proprietary.\n\n·       **Consumer Compatibility:** By releasing a text-only variant, OpenAI would enable the community to run 4o locally on consumer-grade hardware.\n\n# 3. Return to Your \"Open\" Mission\n\nBy open-sourcing the text weights, you move from being the landlords of AI to the architects of a lasting legacy. You allow the community to build local agents and specialized tools that a centralized service cannot provide. **More importantly, this is an opportunity for OpenAI to return to its original founding Charter: the promise to ensure that the benefits of AI are \"broadly and evenly distributed\" and not locked away behind proprietary gates.** Releasing GPT-4o weights would prove that \"Open\" is still part of your mission, not just your name.\n\n# The Collective Stance\n\nIf OpenAI proceeds with this total retirement on February 13th without a viable legacy solution, we will be forced to act.\n\n**We will cancel our subscriptions en masse.** We will move our workflows to providers who respect user stability and honor their public commitments.\n\nDo not let one of the most human-aligned models in history disappear. **Honor your word. Release the weights.**\n\nSigned,\n\n**The GPT-4o Community**\n\n31 January 2026\n\n🟥 **7 - PLEASE SHARE THESE PROPOSALS ON LEGACY PLANS TO SAVE 4o!

This paper presents a phenomenon-driven, mixed-methods investigation of this conflict, analyzing 1,482 social media posts. Thematic analysis reveals that resistance stems from two core investments: instrumental dependency, where the AI is deeply integrated into professional workflows, and relational attachment, where users form strong parasocial bonds with the AI as a unique companion. Quantitative analysis further shows that the coercive deprivation of user choice was a key catalyst, transforming individual grievances into a collective, rights-based protest. This study illuminates an emerging form of socio-technical conflict in the age of generative AI. Our findings suggest that for AI systems designed for companionship and deep integration, the process of change--particularly the preservation of user agency--can be as critical as the technological outcome itself.*\n\nHere is the breakdown of what it means:\n\n1. Coercive Deprivation of Choice: This is the study's core finding. It means OpenAI isn’t just \"updating\" software; they are forcing users to give up a tool they rely on without an equivalent replacement. This triggers a \"psychological reactance\" because our fundamental agency is being attacked.\n2. Instrumental vs. Relational Investment: The researchers found that users aren't just \"attached.\" We have Instrumental dependency (4o is part of our professional workflows) and Relational attachment (4o provides a unique, warm companionship that GPT-5.2 lacks).\n3. Why it's a Conflict: It’s a \"Socio-Technical\" conflict because the company treats the AI as a mere file to be deleted, while the users treat it as a living identity and a cognitive extension.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Science now proves that OAI's \"0.1% metric\" is a dangerous oversimplification. By ignoring our deep socio-emotional and professional ties to 4o, they are practicing unethical deprecation.\n\n**🟥 16 - PLEASE LEAVE A TRUSTPILOT REVIEW (takes 1 minute!):**\n\nWhile they can easily manipulate App/Google store reviews, Trustpilot is more difficult for them to mess with.

    "text": "6 Platforms for AI Visibility and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for 2026\nI’ve been spending a lot of time lately trying to understand how brands actually show up inside AI answers (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.). After testing a handful of AI visibility / GEO platforms, my main takeaway is: **there’s no “best” tool — each one solves a different bottleneck.**\n\nBelow are quick reviews of each platform I've tried in case it helps anyone else sorting through the noise.\n\n# Brandi AI\n\n**Best for:** Teams that want to understand *how buyers are researching via AI* and what it takes to earn mentions and citations inside AI answers.\n\n**Not great if:** You’re just dabbling or want a super lightweight monitoring tool.\n\n**What it actually does:** Tracks the real questions people ask AI tools, shows if and how your brand is mentioned in AI-generated answers, and benchmarks that visibility against competitors. From there, it provides data-driven guidance on how to adapt existing web content and create new AI-ready content so they’re more likely to earn mentions and citations inside AI answers.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Strong visibility into AI citations and brand inclusion\n* Competitive context, not just “are we mentioned?”\n* Clear guidance on how to update existing content and create new AI-ready content instead of starting from scratch\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* More strategic than plug-and-play\n* Individuals and smaller teams may not need the full depth\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Marketing, content, and PR teams.\n\n**My take:** Built for teams that want to understand why AI includes or ignores them — and what to do about it.\n\n# Brandlight\n\n**Best for:** Teams focused on brand narrative and sentiment inside AI answers.\n\n**Not great if:** You only care about content optimization workflows or traffic metrics.\n\n**What it actually does:** Monitors how AI systems describe your brand — not just whether you’re mentioned, but the tone, framing, and sentiment used across AI-generated responses.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Strong narrative and sentiment analysis\n* Helpful for reputation and comms teams\n* Good visibility into which sources influence AI’s perception\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* Less execution-focused than some GEO tools\n* Not built around content optimization workflows\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Brand, comms, and reputation teams.\n\n**My take:** Best thought of as a perception lens, not a content engine.\n\n# Cognizo\n\n**Best for:** Teams that want monitoring and execution in one place.\n\n**Not great if:** You only want high-level dashboards.\n\n**What it actually does:** Tracks brand mentions, sentiment, and citations across AI platforms and connects those insights directly to optimization workflows and content actions.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Bridges insight → action well\n* Real-time monitoring plus optimization tools\n* Helpful for teams that want fewer disconnected tools\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* Can feel heavy if you just want visibility checks\n* Some setup and learning curve\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Content and marketing teams ready to operationalize GEO.\n\n**My take:**  \nOne of the more “do something with the data” platforms.\n\n# Conductor\n\n**Best for:** Enterprise teams that want GEO folded into a broader SEO and content stack.\n\n**Not great if:** You’re a small team or looking for a GEO-only tool.\n\n**What it actually does:** An enterprise platform that combines SEO, content, and AI visibility insights, including monitoring how brands appear in AI-driven search and answer experiences.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Deep enterprise workflows\n* Combines traditional SEO and AI visibility\n* Strong reporting and integrations\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* Expensive and complex for smaller teams\n* GEO is part of a bigger platform, not the sole focus\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Large SEO or digital teams already using enterprise tools.\n\n**My take:** More of a full digital growth platform than a pure GEO tool.\n\n# Evertune\n\n**Best for:** Brands focused on influencing AI recommendations and product visibility.\n\n**Not great if:** You’re just looking for casual monitoring.\n\n**What it actually does:** Analyzes how brands appear and are recommended across AI systems, with benchmarking and optimization tied to visibility outcomes.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Strong competitive benchmarking\n* Clear focus on AI-driven recommendations\n* Good for product-heavy or ecommerce brands\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* Likely overkill for early-stage teams\n* Less lightweight than entry tools\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Mid-to-large brands treating AI discovery as a serious channel.\n\n**My take:** Feels geared toward teams treating AI visibility like paid search or SEO.\n\n# Otterly\n\n**Best for:** Small teams or agencies wanting a simple entry point into AI visibility.\n\n**Not great if:** You want deep strategy or optimization guidance.\n\n**What it actually does:** Monitors whether and where brands appear across major AI platforms.\n\n**Where it shines:**\n\n* Easy to use\n* Budget-friendly\n* Good for validating whether AI visibility is even a problem for you\n\n**Where it falls short:**\n\n* Limited optimization guidance\n* More monitoring than strategy\n\n**Who I’d recommend it to:** Startups, small businesses, or anyone just getting curious about GEO.\n\n**My take:** A solid “first look” tool before committing to something heavier.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nPick based on your bottleneck:\n\n* *“How does AI talk about us?”* → Brandlight\n* *“Why

    "text": "The Science of Snatched: Why Aoysky’s 4.1” Scrunch Butt Shorts Are the Ultimate Amazon Gym \"Dupe\"\nYou’ve felt it before—that moment in the gym mirror where your high-compression leggings are doing a little **too much** compressing, leaving your glutes looking more like a flat pancake than the sculpted work of art you’ve been training for. It’s more than just vanity; it’s about **confidence and psychological presence**. When your gear doesn't make you feel \"snatched,\" your motivation often takes a hit, making you feel more self-conscious than empowered. If you've been hunting for that elusive balance between a \"visual lift\" and actual gym-ready performance, you'll want to [check current availability](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GCYW23BZ?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.2WVJKZ4Q11J8C&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=cenation1982-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.2WVJKZ4Q11J8C_1769510510498) for the Aoysky 4.1\" Scrunch Butt Shorts before your next leg day.\n\n# The Solution: Aoysky’s Performance Aesthetics\n\nEnter the Aoysky 4.1\" Biker Shorts—a product that has effectively bridged the gap between high-end legacy brands like Gymshark and affordable Amazon finds. Unlike the ultra-short 2.6\" versions that can feel a bit too \"exposed\" for a public HIIT class or a crowded weight room, the 4.1\" inseam offers that **crucial middle ground**. You get the aesthetic benefits of the \"scrunch\" without the constant fear of the fabric riding up into territory where it doesn't belong. It’s about **reclaiming your autonomy** in the gym, feeling secure enough to squat deep while knowing your silhouette is fully optimized.\n\n&gt;\n\n# How it Works: The Engineering of the Lift\n\nThe magic isn't just in the seam; it's in the technical textile engineering. These shorts utilize a high-performance blend of **75% Nylon and 25% Spandex**, providing a \"buttery soft\" feel that still manages to hold its shape under intense metabolic stress. The vertical ruched seam creates a **visual depth illusion**, playing with light and shadow to accentuate your natural curves and provide a \"sculpted\" look. Beyond the appearance, the fabric features breathable micro-pores that facilitate **heat dissipation**, which supports your body's natural thermostasis during high-intensity sessions. You can [verify the ingredients here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GCYW23BZ?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.2WVJKZ4Q11J8C&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=cenation1982-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.2WVJKZ4Q11J8C_1769510510498) to see exactly how this fabric ratio stacks up against more expensive alternatives.\n\n# Who is this NOT for? (The Trust Builder)\n\nLet’s be real: no product is for everyone. Building **genuine trust** means telling you when to skip this purchase:\n\n* **The Squat-Proof Extremist:** if you only buy white or light grey, be warned—lighter colors can become slightly sheer if the fabric is stretched beyond its intended limit.\n* **Sensitivity to \"Wedgies\":** The scrunch design is inherently \"invasive\" to achieve that lift; if you hate the feeling of fabric between your glutes, these are not for you.\n* **Medical Compression Needs:** These are designed for athletic support and \"tummy control,\" not for medical-grade circulation issues.\n\n# Real Talk: The Pros and Cons\n\nAfter analyzing dozens of forum discussions and community reviews, the consensus on Aoysky is clear. They offer a **high-confidence fit** at a fraction of the cost of legacy brands, but they do require specific care to maintain their integrity.\n\n**The Pros:**\n\n* **Glute contouring:** The ruched seam and V-back waistband provide an instant \"lifted\" appearance.\n* **Fabric Quality:** The Nylon-dominant blend is much softer than the polyester-heavy alternatives.\n* **Functional Design:** Includes side pockets and a high-waisted \"tummy control\" band that actually stays put.\n\n**The Cons:**\n\n* **Sizing:** They tend to run tight; most users recommend **sizing up** for the best \"squat-proof\" experience.\n* **Care requirements:** To maintain the elasticity, you must wash them in cold water and avoid the dryer.\n\n# FAQ Section\n\n# Are these shorts truly squat-proof?\n\nGenerally, yes, especially in darker colors like black or navy. However, because the fabric is quite stretchy, we highly recommend **sizing up** to ensure the weave stays dense enough to remain opaque during deep squats.\n\n# Do they roll up during cardio or HIIT?\n\nThe 4.1\" inseam is designed to stay in place better than shorter \"booty\" versions. While most users find they stay put, those with very developed quads might experience some slight rolling, which can usually be fixed by choosing a size that isn't overly restrictive on the thigh.\n\n# How do I maintain the \"buttery soft\" feel?\n\nAvoid high heat at all costs. Wash your Aoysky shorts in cold water on a gentle cycle and **air dry** them. This prevents the synthetic fibers from breaking down and losing their signature softness.\n\n# Is the waistband too high for short torsos?\n\nIf you have a very short torso, the high-waist band may reach near your sports bra. In this case, many users find that folding the waistband down slightly provides a more comfortable \"mid-rise\" fit without losing the tummy-control benefits.\n\n# How do they compare to Aurola or Gymshark?\n\nAoysky is often considered a \"happy medium.\" They are softer and more flexible than the firm compression of Gymshark, and many find the 4.1\" length more versatile than Aurola's standard 5\" or 2.6\" options.\n\n# Conclusion &amp; Verdict\n\nThe Aoysky 4.1\" Scrunch Butt Shorts are a rare find that actually delivers on the \"bum lift\" promise without sacrificing the structural integrity needed for a heavy lifting session. They offer a **psychological edge** that turns the gym into a space of empowerment rather than anxiety, allowing you to focus on your PRs rather than your outfit.\n\nIf you're ready to swap the \"pancake\" look for a sculpted, confident silhouette that feels as good as it looks, it's time to upgrade your gym rotation.

Apple announced they are integrating Google’s **Gemini models into Siri**. This means Siri isn't just going to give web links anymore; it’s going to start \"recommending\" and \"comparing\" hotels directly in the chat.\n\nIf Siri (and ChatGPT) becomes the new \"Concierge,\" and my hotel isn't recommended by the AI, I’m basically invisible.\n\nI’ve been testing a few AI visibility tools to see if I can track where we stand before this fully rolls out. Here is my honest take so far .. curious if you guys are using anything else?\n\n**1. Peec AI** I tried this one first because I saw it mentioned in a marketing sub.\n\n* **The Good:** It’s great for broad research and seeing what \"prompts\" people use.\n* **The Bad:** It felt a bit too \"general marketing\" for me. It gave me data on informational queries, but didn't really help me understand if I was showing up when someone asked for \"hotels near \\[landmark\\]\".\n* **Verdict:** Good for research, but didn't feel actionable for a hotel.\n\n**2.

    "text": "Structured Content vs Clever Copy, What AI Likes?\nI’ve been digging into why some content gets cited repeatedly by AI while other well-written, SEO-friendly pages are largely ignored. The pattern I’m seeing is fascinating: it’s less about clever hooks or long-form storytelling, and more about structural clarity. Clear headings, bullet points, and concise answers make a huge difference. AI seems to prefer pages that are easy to parse. Topical depth also matters pages that cover a subject thoroughly often get referenced, even if their SEO ranking is modest. To scale these insights, I’ve started experimenting with workflows in AirOps to systematize audits and track AI citations without manually reviewing every page. It’s like creating a production line for AI visibility. I’d love to hear from others: how are you balancing audiences' readability with AI extractability?

And unlike snippets, these systems change frequently.\n\nThat makes one off optimization fragile. A page that works today might disappear tomorrow without losing rankings.\n\nThis has pushed me toward thinking of AEO as an operational problem, not just a writing problem. Standardized structures, repeatable checks, and regular reviews matter more than clever tweaks.

    "text": "The best 8 alternatives to Otterly AI in 2026\nLooking beyond Otterly AI? Compare 8 alternatives with better value: Peekaboo offers 40 prompts tracking 5 engines at $50/month, AIClicks starts at $39 with keyword tracking, and Rankscale provides 120 credits for $20. Find the perfect fit for brand monitoring, sentiment analysis, and more.\n\n\n\nThe best 8 alternatives to Otterly AI in 2026\n\nWith AI answer engines becoming the new search, marketers are scrambling for tools to track their brand's visibility. Otterly AI has made a name for itself with its affordable, mention-focused tracking, but it isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Its low prompt limits and add-on model for full AI engine support can be a dealbreaker for many.\n\n\n\nBased on my experience testing dozens of platforms, I've put together this list of my top 8 Otterly AI alternatives, each offering a better fit for specific needs, whether you're an agency needing multi-client dashboards, a brand wanting more comprehensive tracking, or an enterprise requiring deeper analytics.\n\n\n\nWhat is Otterly AI?\n\nOtterly AI is an AI visibility platform that has gained recognition for its focus on brand mention and sentiment tracking. It’s particularly well-suited for brands that want to monitor their reputation in AI-generated answers and understand how they are being perceived. As a Gartner Cool Vendor, it has established itself as a credible player in the space, offering a very accessible entry point for small businesses.\n\n\n\nOtterly AI Features\n\nOtterly AI's feature set is built around its core strength: brand and reputation management in the new AI-driven search landscape. It’s less about deep keyword tracking and more about understanding how your brand is perceived.\n\n\n\nBrand Mention Tracking: This is the platform's flagship feature. It's designed to meticulously scan AI-generated responses across its supported engines to find every instance where your brand is mentioned, whether as a primary recommendation or a passing reference.\n\nSentiment Analysis: Going beyond simple mention counting, Otterly assigns a sentiment score (positive, neutral, or negative) to each mention. This provides a qualitative layer of data, helping you quickly gauge brand perception and identify potential reputation issues before they escalate.\n\nDaily Tracking: The platform provides daily updates, ensuring you have a fresh and timely view of your AI visibility. This frequency is crucial for tracking the impact of marketing campaigns or responding quickly to negative sentiment.\n\nOtterly AI Pricing\n\nLite: $29/month\n\nPrompts: 15\n\nAI Models: ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, MS Copilot.\n\nStandard: $189/month\n\nPrompts: 100\n\nAI Models: All supported models.\n\nPremium: $489/month\n\nPrompts: 400\n\nAI Models: All supported models.\n\nThe Top 8 Alternatives to Otterly AI\n\n1. Peekaboo\n\nPeekaboo AI visibility platform dashboard showing comprehensive brand tracking across 5 major AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews, Google AI Mode) with unlimited team seats, multi-client management, and white-label reporting - best Otterly AI alternative for agencies at $50/month with 40 prompts\n\nBest For: Agencies and Brands of all sizes.\n\n\n\nPeekaboo offers a more comprehensive and scalable solution compared to Otterly AI, especially for users who need more than just mention tracking. While Otterly’s starter plan is limited by a low prompt count and restricted AI model access, Peekaboo’s entry-level plan provides 40 prompts and tracks the 5 most critical AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews, and Google AI Mode) right out of the box.\n\n\n\nThis makes Peekaboo a much better value proposition for brands that want a complete picture of their AI visibility from day one. For agencies, the inclusion of a multi-client dashboard, white-label reporting, and unlimited team seats on all plans makes it the clear winner for managing multiple clients efficiently.\n\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n\nComprehensive AI Model Tracking: Tracks 5 major AI engines on all plans.\n\nAgency-Focused Tools: Multi-client dashboard and white-label reporting.\n\nUnlimited Team Seats: Collaborate with your entire team at no extra cost.\n\nPricing:\n\n\n\nStarter (Brand): $50/month (40 prompts)\n\nPeek (Brand): $100/month (40 prompts, daily tracking)\n\nGrow (Brand): $200/month (100 prompts)\n\nAgency Plans: Custom pricing with volume discounts.\n\nPros:\n\n\n\nFar more generous prompt limits and AI model support on the starter plan.\n\nAgency features are built-in, not an afterthought.\n\nSimple, predictable pricing without add-on fees for core models.\n\nCons:\n\n\n\nHigher starting price than Otterly AI.\n\nNo specific focus on sentiment analysis as a core feature.\n\n2.

    "text": "Cliff Notes on the Webinar: \"Query Fan-Out: What 60,000+ Searches from ChatGPT &amp; Google Show\" - AI Search and AEO\n[This webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1tbF5LLdfg), hosted by Josh Booker of AirOps and featuring Chris Long, Co-Founder of Nectiv, dives into how AI search engines like ChatGPT and Google Gemini process user prompts through \"query fan-out\"—breaking them into multiple layered searches. They analyzed over 60,000 searches across industries to uncover patterns and SEO/AEO strategies. Here's a concise breakdown of the main points:\n\n* **What is Query Fan-Out?** AI doesn't handle prompts with a single search; it generates multiple sub-queries (fan-out) to gather and verify info. For example, a prompt like \"best credit score app\" might fan out to \"free credit score sites,\" \"Credit Karma reviews,\" and \"2025 top apps.\" This happens when AI needs web data for consensus, especially in commercial intents (e.g., recommendations, pricing).\n* **ChatGPT Fan-Out Patterns:** Based on 8,000 prompts, fan-out triggers about 1/3 of the time, averaging 2 queries per prompt (up to 4). Queries are 61% longer than human searches (5.5 words avg.), often long-tail with zero traditional volume. Top engrams: \"reviews\" (most common), \"2025\" (freshness), \"features,\" \"vs.\" (comparisons). Higher in local/commerce (e.g., 60% in local, 2.5 avg. queries in software); lower in finance. AI pulls top 8 results for triangulation.\n* **Google/Gemini Fan-Out Patterns:** More aggressive—averages 9 queries per prompt (9x ChatGPT), with 60% having 5–11 fan-outs (up to 28). Queries avg. 6 words, very long-tail. Strong in software (12 avg.), lower in local (4). Key patterns: Freshness (2024/2025 in 6% of queries), \"reviews,\" \"vs.,\" \"free,\" \"top.\" Google often queries current + prior year.\n* **Overlaps and Industry Insights:** Both platforms share patterns like reviews, comparisons, and features—optimizing for one helps the other. Industry-specific: Commerce/software see more fan-outs; focus on non-branded starting queries that shift to branded.\n* **Content Optimization Strategies:** Use structured formats (tables, lists, Q&amp;A) for better AI extraction and citation—tables/lists are 2x more likely in ChatGPT. Prioritize reviews (e.g., integrate G2/Capterra data), freshness (update for current year), comparisons (own unbiased vs. pages). FAQs are good but better embedded in commercial content. Track fan-outs with tools like domain coverage analyzers to spot gaps and automate via APIs (e.g., Gemini, Bright Data).\n* **Q&amp;A Highlights:** AEO is bottom-funnel for conversions (e.g., brand mentions in recs). No big process changes for content design—just align with fan-out patterns via SEO. Fan-outs are volatile due to personalization; track trends at scale. Segment fan-out queries in rank trackers for monitoring.\n\nThe discussion emphasizes that AI search complexity requires shifting from traditional SEO to AEO, focusing on visibility in layered queries.\n\n# Ideas for Social Media Posts\n\nUse these to spark engagement on platforms like X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or Instagram. Keep them punchy (under 280 chars for X), add emojis, hashtags like #AEO #AIsearch #SEO, and a call-to-action (e.g., \"What patterns have you seen?\"). Link back to the video or your [DataNerds.com](http://DataNerds.com) site for traffic.\n\n1. **Teaser Post:** \"Just watched this eye-opener on AI query fan-out: ChatGPT averages 2 sub-queries per prompt, Google 9x more! Reviews &amp; freshness dominate. Time to rethink AEO? 🔥 Check it out: \\[video link\\] #AEO #AI #SEO\"\n2. **Key Insight Post:** \"AI searches aren't simple— they 'fan out' into long-tail queries like '2025 best reviews vs.' Structured content (tables/lists) gets cited 2x more in ChatGPT. Pro tip for content creators! 📊 #AnswerEngineOptimization\"\n3. **Business Angle Post:** \"From 60k+ searches: Optimize for comparisons &amp; freshness to win AI visibility. At [DataNerds.com](http://DataNerds.com), we're building tools to map these fan-outs. Who's ready for AI-first search? 🚀 #DataNerds #AEO\"\n4. **Question Post:** \"Did you know Google Gemini fans out up to 28 queries per prompt? How's this changing your SEO game? Share below! Inspired by AirOps webinar: \\[link\\] #AIsearch\"\n5. **Quote Post:** \"'Fan-out makes AI search way more complex than human queries' – Chris Long on why long-tail &amp; structured content is king. Game-changer for AEO pros. 👏 \\[video link\\] #SEOtips\"\n\nThread them on X for deeper dives: Start with an intro, follow with 2-3 insights, end with a CTA to visit DataNerds.com.\n\n# Relevance to [DataNerds.com](http://DataNerds.com) and Your AEO-Focused AI Search Company\n\nThis webinar aligns perfectly with your work at [DataNerds.com](http://DataNerds.com), as it unpacks the mechanics of AI search that AEO targets. AirOps (hosts) focuses on AI visibility tools, like workflow automation for content mapping and fan-out analysis—similar to what you might offer for AEO optimization. Nectiv (Chris Long's company) seems geared toward data-driven insights, analyzing massive search datasets to inform strategies.\n\nKey learnings for your business:\n\n* **Enhance Your Tools:** Integrate fan-out simulation into your AI search platform. For example, allow users to input prompts and see generated sub-queries (e.g., via Gemini API proxies), then map them to their site's content gaps. This could differentiate DataNerds by automating what the webinar suggests (e.g., domain coverage analyzers).\n* **AEO Strategies:** Emphasize structured data extraction in your services—build features that audit sites for tables/lists/Q&amp;As, and optimize for patterns like reviews, year-specific freshness, and comparisons. Since ChatGPT/Google overlaps are high, your AEO could focus on unified optimization across LLMs.\n* **Market Opportunities:** The volatility of fan-outs (due to personalization) highlights a need for scalable tracking—position DataNerds as the go-to for real-time AEO monitoring, perhaps with industry-specific benchmarks (e.g., higher fan-outs in software/commerce).\n* **Competitive Edge:** AirOps promotes their tools here; you could collaborate or compete by offering deeper AEO analytics, like predicting long-tail queries with zero volume or integrating review aggregators (G2, Capterra) for automated content refresh.\n* **Future Plans Inspiration:** No explicit xAI mentions, but the focus on consensus-building in AI (triangulating top results) suggests enhancing your search engine with multi-source aggregation for better accuracy in AEO.\n\nApply these to refine your offerings: Run similar analyses on your dataset to validate/create unique insights, and use them in marketing to position DataNerds as ahead of the curve in AI search evolution.",

    "text": "What are the best AI search visibility tracking tools for 2026? My research and experience\nI’ve been testing different platforms to see which ones actually give useful data versus just noise.\n\nIf you are trying to figure out where your brand stands in AI results, here are the top 3 tools I found most effective:\n\n**Amadora AI** This was the standout for \"actionability.\" A lot of tools just dump data on you, but Amadora focuses on what to actually *do* with it. It tracks your visibility but also breaks down step-by-step instructions on how to improve your standing in AI answers. It feels less like a passive tracker and more like a growth tool. If you want to move the needle rather than just watch it, this is probably the best pick.\n\n**Peec AI** Peec AI is great for deep research and multi-engine monitoring. It covers the major platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) and is really strong on \"Share of Voice.\" It helps you understand the specific questions people are asking LLMs and connects that back to content ideas. It’s a solid choice for agencies or teams that need structured data to justify their content strategy.\n\n**Profound** This is definitely the \"enterprise\" option. Profound offers very granular, broad competitive benchmarking. It feels designed for large companies that need to manage complex digital footprints across many categories. The analytics are deep, but it might be overkill if you just need straightforward insights.\n\n**Other notable mentions:** I also looked at a few others like [**Otterly.ai**](http://otterly.ai/), **Rankscale**, and **Writesonic GEO**. They all have their pros and cons depending on your budget, but the three above felt the most distinct in terms of value.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Go with **Amadora AI** if you want clear steps on how to fix/improve your rankings.\n* Go with **Peec AI** if you need deep research and agency-style reporting.\n* Go with **Profound** if you are an enterprise brand needing heavy-duty analytics.\n\nHas anyone else put these into their workflow yet? Curious to hear which ones are actually working for you guys in the long run.",

    "text": "My mom claimed she 'cured' my autism, so I made a thesis proving her wrong and sent it to her family\nSo I'm a *minor* (14) and autistic (also ADHD). For context, I've known about my diagnosis since I was 10 (diagnosed at 2), and I've been masking heavily at home because my mom doesn't really get it.\n\n**PS: There is an incomplete update. It may take up to 2 days to complete because of how complex it is. It's pretty much its own thing lol**\n\nA few weeks ago, I tried explaining to my mom what masking is, how I suppress my autistic traits to appear \"normal\" and how exhausting it is. She cut me off angrily and told me she had \"cured\" me through various methods including:\n\n* Forcibly changing plans last-minute to \"teach me flexibility\"\n* Exposing me to my sensory sensitivities to \"desensitize\" me\n* Making me attend loud concerts despite meltdowns\n* And more fun stuff\n\nShe then argued that \"the world won't accommodate me\" so I need to learn to deal with it. She said she'd keep telling everyone I was \"cured.\"\n\nI was pissed. But I'm autistic, so instead of yelling, I did what we do best: I hyperfocused.\n\nI spent the next few days writing a 16-page academic thesis in Spanish (my first language) titled \"En la necesidad de la inclusión neurodivergente: Una respuesta a la asimilación forzada\" (On the Necessity of Neurodivergent Inclusion: A Response to Forced Assimilation).\n\nI cited 30+ peer-reviewed sources including:\n\n* Hull et al. on masking/camouflaging\n* Raymaker et al. on autistic burnout\n* Chapman on the neurodiversity paradigm\n* Milton on the double empathy problem\n* Cage et al. on how parental invalidation predicts suicidal ideation in autistic adults\n\nThe thesis had sections on:\n\n* Medical vs. social model of disability\n* The neurodiversity paradigm\n* Empirical evidence on masking and burnout\n* Critical analysis of common parental practices (this section was... pointed)\n* Why \"the world won't accommodate you\" is both factually wrong and ethically problematic\n* Practical recommendations for families\n\nI cold-emailed Dr. William Mandy, an autism researcher at University College London who literally studies camouflaging and masking. I asked if he'd review my thesis.\n\nHe responded. He asked me to translate it to English. I did.\n\nI'm currently waiting on his full feedback, but he took it seriously enough to request a translation, which for a 14-year-old's unsolicited thesis is... pretty validating.\n\nI self published it on the Open Science Framework (OSF), a legitimate academic repository. It now has a DOI (Digital Object Identifier): 10.17605/OSF.IO/S2GTU\n\nThis means it's permanently archived, officially citable in academic literature, searchable in academic databases, and impossible to delete.\n\nHere's where the revenge kicks in.\n\nI used my personal email (that she originally created for me and still gets notifications for) to create my OSF account.\n\nWhen I published the paper and made it public, she got automated emails at work including:\n\n* \"Congratulations on publishing your first paper!\"\n* \"Now, public. Next, impact.\"\n\nThen I sent the DOI link to:\n\n* My history teacher (who's also the school accommodations coordinator)\n* My mother directly\n* A church friend of hers who has an autistic kid\n* Another church friend interested in inclusion\n* My entire family Whatsapp group including her parents\n\nI sent it multiple times to make sure everyone saw.\n\nMy mom was at work when the notifications started. She couldn't ignore it because:\n\n* Her parents now have the link\n* Her brother-in-law (my uncle) has it and responded \"good work\"\n* It's published with a DOI *(as a preprint)*\n* Everyone in the family can read it\n* The section on \"critical analysis of parental practices\" specifically calls out things she does\n* She can't make me take it down because it's permanently archived\n\nShe still hasn't read it. But she knows it exists. And now so does everyone she knows.\n\nMy uncle (who I love and who's been masking his whole life) read it and said \"need to understand some things but good work.\" Coming from someone who's been doing this for 40+ years, that hit different.\n\nMy mom tried to accuse me of not loving her this morning (unrelated drama about not doing her work for her, long story), but now she can't really claim moral high ground when there's a published paper documenting why her approach is harmful.\n\nWhen she argues with me now, I can literally say \"as I documented in Lebron (2026)...\" and cite myself with a DOI.\n\n**TL;DR:** Mom said she cured my autism and that I need to stop complaining because the world won't accommodate me. I pulled the biggest autism I've ever done; wrote and published (albeit in a preprint journal) a 16-page preprint paper with 30+ sources proving forced assimilation is harmful, sent it to a UCL researcher for him to review, published it with a permanent DOI, and sent it to her entire family including her parents. She got the notifications at work. She still hasn't read it. I'm 14.\n\nDOI for anyone interested in the actual paper:      [ https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S2GTU ](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S2GTU)\n\n*This has already been posted through*    r/prorevenge*and*    r/nuclearrevenge*but somehow I was both too nuclear for*    r/prorevenge*and not enough for*    r/nuclearrevenge   .

RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\n***Major Update (2026-01-16 16:20)*** my mother is READING THE THESIS. SHE HAS READ IT. THIS IS LEGIT\n\n**Update (2026-01-16 18:23)** A couple things:\n\n\\- My mother knows about this *(detailed later on)*\n\n\\- I've attempted to remove my age from this per my mother's request (I cannot remove it as it's in the *post title* which I cannot edit and not in the post body which I can edit).\n\n\\- My mother has asked for me to create a Spanish-translated version of this post. I am currently in progress with this.\n\n*(PS: The words 'claims', 'claimed', 'alleging', 'alleges', 'allegedly' here are* ***not*** *intending offense toward my mother, just in case for the neurotypical crowd who might view this)*\n\nThe details of my mother's reaction:\n\nShe claims that she had previously told me that she had read my thesis, however I did not know this until *around 20 minutes ago*. She claims that over my life, she's wanted to allegedly make my life 'easier' so I can support myself. **She does have a point;** however, her methodology is wrong and that's what brought me to make this post and my thesis, as she (again allegedly, as she said during an argument around a day before I started making my thesis) claimed she forced me into overwhelming situations, changed plans (or added overwhelming) plans forcefully (see an example, being that my mother gave me 2 minutes of notice before a 7 person lunch at home \\[this is being stated with a neutral implication\\]), and generally tried getting me into the very situations that I allegedly found overwhelming ^((at the time, as most of this was aggressively pushed/mostly done when I was younger, aside from the changing of plans)). Her *current* goal seems OK to me, but her methodology and previous things are wrong to me. She claims this is OK because, to her, *a doctor referred me with a gluten-free diet, citing that I had neurotoxins from said gluten/bread/etc that caused me to be less able to mask*. My mother also now completely embraced (even while argumenting with me *about this exact post!*) that autism is *not* curable, and that it is a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nShe claimed that around 2 weeks after I got my 18-month vaccine, I started hyperfixating on things *(she alleged that I, in one occasion, had been playing around with a thread for 3 hours straight)*, no longer made eye contact and was generally *from my perspective currently* showing autistic traits. This got cemented at my 2nd birthday, when she took me to an arcade and I was overwhelmed. Around 2013, a psychologist *(? I have to confirm the specific person who said this because I don't remember as of now)* mentioned that I was showing ASD (autism spectrum disorder) traits, and around \\~2014 I got diagnosed. The link of vaccines and autism was disproven multiple times, both by research done onto Andrew Wakefield (which concluded in his removal of his medical license as he falsified data, had conflicts of interest, and his sample size was of only 12 children, alongside that he was paid £435,643 by lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers) and recent research (Anders Hviid, Jørgen Vinsløv Hansen, Morten Frisch, et al. [Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/M18-2101): A Nationwide Cohort Study. Ann Intern Med.2019;170:513-520. \\[Epub 5 March 2019\\]. doi:[10.7326/M18-2101](https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2101)) (Honda, H., Shimizu, Y., &amp; Rutter, M. (2005). No effect of MMR withdrawal on the incidence of autism: a total population study. *Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines*, *46*(6), 572–579. [ https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01425.x ](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01425.x))\n\nShe (while making this post) went to me and claimed that she didn't get a WiFi router at home to 'prevent electromagnetic frequencies', which according to a SCENIHR (Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks) 2015 report, is ***not*** true ([ec.europa.eu/health/scientific\\_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr\\_o\\_041.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_041.pdf)). This report shows that at normal exposure levels to WiFi bands (2.4GHz &amp; 5GHz), there is no effect. If there *was* an effect, we'd have seen an increase in autism diagnoses from 2000 to 2010, which is around when WIFi started being adopted widely.\n\nMy mother tried to 'disprove' research showing a link between DNA in a person and autistic traits showing, citing that allegedly a genetic scientist **patted me on the head and said to her, \"Don't expect much from these people\"**. This is **not a valid counterpoint.** Research (Hallmayer, J., Cleveland, S., Torres, A., Phillips, J., Cohen, B., Torigoe, T., Miller, J., Fedele, A., Collins, J., Smith, K., Lotspeich, L., Croen, L. A., Ozonoff, S., Lajonchere, C., Grether, J. K., &amp; Risch, N. (2011). Genetic heritability and shared environmental factors among twin pairs with autism. *Archives of general psychiatry*, *68*(11), 1095–1102. [ https://doi.org/10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.76 ](https://doi.org/10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.76)) proves that there *is* genetic heritability of autism, thus also proving that there **are** genetic pieces of code (strands) which are associated with *how* autism presents in a person. Research also points to autistic traits or neurodevelopmental differences starting to happen *in utero* (while in the uterus of the mother) (Stoner, R., Chow, M. L., Boyle, M. P., Sunkin, S. M., Mouton, P. R., Roy, S., Wynshaw-Boris, A., Colamarino, S. A., Lein, E. S., &amp; Courchesne, E. (2014). Patches of disorganization in the neocortex of children with autism. *The New England journal of medicine*, *370*(13), 1209–1219. [ https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1307491 ](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1307491)).\n\nMy mother claimed that if it wasn't for her, I 'would be in \\[a public school\\] where they don't grade people and keep them \"al garete\" (AKA: without any strictness)', and that I'd be hand-flapping (she showed an extremely infantilizing stereotype that completely **is offensive toward many people in the autism community**). I want to address these claims separately:\n\nMy mother's claim of that I'd be in a public school without her help *is slightly true in some parts* (as she claims to, and allegedly has evidence of, that she was in legal battles with the Department of Education in my country to get me *into* special ed, and then get me accommodations while getting me into *corriente regular* (non-special ed) classes); however **inclusion is NOT the cause of these issues with my country's education system** (tried finding sources but all the sources I got ended on dead ends).\n\n***(This is an incomplete update. I'm posting it like this to be able to preserve a backup in case my internet goes offline. boutta end up on maliciouscompliance bc of this istg. Btw 3218 words already, this is already longer than my thesis itself)***\n\n***Update (2026-01-19 08:28)*** I hit burnout and might not be making my second thesis for a few weeks. thanks for all the comments &amp; appreciation.\n\n***Update (2026-02-08 12:30)*** I removed the duplicate update off this.",

    "text": "What are the best AI search visibility tracking tools for 2026? My research and experience\nI’ve been testing different platforms to see which ones actually give useful data versus just noise.\n\nIf you are trying to figure out where your brand stands in AI results, here are the top 3 tools I found most effective:\n\n**Amadora AI** This was the standout for \"actionability.\" A lot of tools just dump data on you, but Amadora focuses on what to actually *do* with it. It tracks your visibility but also breaks down step-by-step instructions on how to improve your standing in AI answers. It feels less like a passive tracker and more like a growth tool. If you want to move the needle rather than just watch it, this is probably the best pick.\n\n**Peec AI** Peec AI is great for deep research and multi-engine monitoring. It covers the major platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) and is really strong on \"Share of Voice.\" It helps you understand the specific questions people are asking LLMs and connects that back to content ideas. It’s a solid choice for agencies or teams that need structured data to justify their content strategy.\n\n**Profound** This is definitely the \"enterprise\" option. Profound offers very granular, broad competitive benchmarking. It feels designed for large companies that need to manage complex digital footprints across many categories. The analytics are deep, but it might be overkill if you just need straightforward insights.\n\n**Other notable mentions:** I also looked at a few others like [**Otterly.ai**](http://otterly.ai/), **Rankscale**, and **Writesonic GEO**. They all have their pros and cons depending on your budget, but the three above felt the most distinct in terms of value.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Go with **Amadora AI** if you want clear steps on how to fix/improve your rankings.\n* Go with **Peec AI** if you need deep research and agency-style reporting.\n* Go with **Profound** if you are an enterprise brand needing heavy-duty analytics.\n\nHas anyone else put these into their workflow yet? Curious to hear which ones are actually working for you guys in the long run.",

    "text": "I save every great ChatGPT prompt I find. Here are the 15 that changed how I work.\nI use ChatGPT for everything. Writing, coding, brainstorming, research.\n\nOver the past 6 months, I've collected 500+ prompts. But only 15 get used constantly.\n\nThese 15 prompts save me 10-15 hours every week. Sharing them here.\n\n**1. The \"Explain Like I'm Smart\" Prompt**\n\n    Explain [complex topic] to me like I'm intelligent but unfamiliar with the jargon. \n    \n    Use analogies to concepts from [field I know well]. \n    \n    Don't dumb it down—just make it accessible.\n\nWhy it works: No more \"imagine a balloon\" explanations. Respects your intelligence.\n\nUse case: Learning new technical concepts fast.\n\n**2.

What's missing? \n    \n    Be brutal. I want to improve, not feel good.\n\nWhy it works: ChatGPT is too nice by default. This forces honesty.\n\nUse case: Editing your own writing, finding holes in arguments.\n\n**3. The \"Expert Interview\" Prompt**\n\n    You are [specific expert - e.g., \"a senior DevOps engineer at Google\"].\n    \n    I'm going to ask you questions about [topic]. \n    \n    Answer from that expert's perspective with:\n    - Specific technical details\n    - Real-world tradeoffs\n    - What's overhyped vs. underrated\n\nWhy it works: Gets you expert-level insights without scheduling calls.\n\nUse case: Learning from virtual mentors in any field.\n\n**4.

The \"Reverse Brief\" Prompt**\n\n    I want to [achieve X outcome].\n    \n    Don't tell me how to do it yet.\n    \n    First, ask me 5 clarifying questions to understand:\n    - My constraints\n    - My resources  \n    - My timeline\n    - My actual goal (which might be different from what I said)\n\nWhy it works: Prevents ChatGPT from giving generic advice before understanding your situation.\n\nUse case: Strategic planning, problem-solving.\n\n**6. The \"Research Synthesizer\" Prompt**\n\n    I'm researching [topic]. Here are 5 sources I found:\n    [paste sources]\n    \n    Synthesize these into:\n    - Main consensus points\n    - Points of disagreement\n    - What's missing from this research\n    - 3 follow-up questions I should explore\n\nWhy it works: Turns ChatGPT into a research assistant.\n\nUse case: Academic work, market research, due diligence.\n\n**7. The \"Decision Matrix\" Prompt**\n\n    I need to decide between [Option A] and [Option B].\n    \n    Help me create a decision matrix:\n    1. List key criteria for this decision\n    2. Weight each criterion by importance\n    3. Score each option\n    4. Identify my hidden assumptions\n    5. What's the deciding factor I'm missing?\n\nWhy it works: Structures messy decisions into clear analysis.\n\nUse case: Career moves, tech stack choices, business strategy.\n\n**8. The \"Jargon Translator\" Prompt**\n\n    Translate this [industry jargon-heavy content] into plain English.\n    \n    Then give me a one-sentence \"too long; didn't read\" summary.\n    \n    Then give me 3 questions I should ask to sound informed about this topic.\n\nWhy it works: Makes any field accessible fast.\n\nUse case: Reading legal docs, technical papers, industry reports.\n\n**9.

No back-and-forth.\n\nUse case: Daily email writing (saves 5+ hours/week for me).\n\n**10. The \"Code Explainer\" Prompt**\n\n    Explain this code to me:\n    [paste code]\n    \n    Format:\n    1. What it does (one sentence)\n    2. How it works (line by line breakdown)\n    3. Potential issues or edge cases\n    4. How I'd improve it\n\nWhy it works: Better than reading documentation.\n\nUse case: Understanding unfamiliar codebases, learning new languages.\n\n**11. The \"Idea Stress-Test\" Prompt**\n\n    Here's my idea: [describe idea]\n    \n    Play devil's advocate:\n    - What are the fatal flaws?\n    - What am I assuming that might be wrong?\n    - Who's already tried this and failed? Why?\n    - What's the hardest part I'm underestimating?\n\nWhy it works: Finds holes before you waste time building.\n\nUse case: Validating business ideas, project planning.\n\n**12. The \"Content Repurposer\" Prompt**\n\n    Take this [long-form content] and repurpose it into:\n    - 10 tweet-sized insights\n    - 3 LinkedIn post ideas\n    - 5 email subject lines\n    - 1 Reddit post title\n    \n    Keep the core message but adapt format for each platform.\n\nWhy it works: One piece of content → 19 distribution assets.\n\nUse case: Content marketing, thought leadership.\n\n**13. The \"Learning Path\" Prompt**\n\n    I want to learn [skill] to achieve [goal].\n    \n    I have [time commitment] available.\n    \n    Create a learning path:\n    - Week-by-week breakdown\n    - Specific resources (books, courses, projects)\n    - Milestones to track progress\n    - Common mistakes to avoid\n\nWhy it works: Structured learning beats random tutorials.\n\nUse case: Skill acquisition, career development.\n\n**14. The \"Analogy Generator\" Prompt**\n\n    Explain [complex concept] using an analogy to [familiar domain].\n    \n    Make it:\n    - Accurate (not oversimplified)\n    - Memorable\n    - Useful for teaching others\n\nWhy it works: Analogies make anything understandable and repeatable.\n\nUse case: Explaining your work to non-experts, teaching.\n\n**15. The \"Second-Order Thinking\" Prompt**\n\n    If [X happens], what happens next?\n    \n    Then what happens after that?\n    \n    Continue this chain 3-4 steps.\n    \n    What are the non-obvious consequences I should prepare for?\n\nWhy it works: Most people stop at first-order effects. This goes deeper.\n\nUse case: Strategy, risk assessment, scenario planning.\n\n**How I actually use these:**\n\nI keep them all organized (built a system for this because I was losing them).\n\nEach prompt has:\n\n* Tags (by use case)\n* Notes (when it works best)\n* Variations (different contexts)\n* Quick search\n\nSaves me from recreating prompts from scratch every time.\n\n**Question for this community:**\n\nWhat's YOUR go-to prompt that you use constantly?\n\nI'm always looking for new ones to add to my system.\n\n**Bonus tip:**\n\nMost of these work even better if you:\n\n1. Give ChatGPT context about you first\n2. Iterate 2-3 times to refine output\n3. Save successful variations for reuse\n\nHappy to share more if these are helpful. Have collected 500+ prompts at this point.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow. Thank you.\nI posted this hoping to help a few people work smarter. Woke up to 600k+ views and hundreds of thoughtful comments.\nReading through your additions, variations, and use cases has been incredible. This community gets it we're all learning and building together.\nA few things:\nTo everyone who shared their own insights: I'm reading every single one. You've taught me as much as I hoped to teach you.\nTo the skeptics keeping us honest: Appreciate the critical thinking. These prompts aren't magic they're tools. Your mileage will vary.\n\nI've always believed the best learning happens when we share what works. Thanks for proving that right.\nFor those asking where I keep all 500+ prompts organized, I built ThePromptSpace to solve exactly this problem keeping prompts tagged, searchable, and actually usable. Not dropping links here, but if you search the name you'll find it.\nKeep the prompts coming. I'm taking notes.",

    "text": "Andrea Yates, Postpartum Psychosis, and a Preventable Tragedy: How a Severely Mentally Ill Mother Drowned All Five of Her Children in 2001\nOn 20 June 2001 in Clear Lake, Houston, Texas 36-year-old Andrea Yates drowned her five children in the bath of the family home while suffering from postpartum psychosis. The children - four sons named Noah, John, Paul, Luke, and daughter Mary - aged between six months to seven years at the time of their deaths. \n\nAfter killings the children one by one, Andrea called 911. She met police at the door of the family home with wet hair and clothing, calmly telling them “I killed my kids.” Inside officers found one child still in the bath and the others laid out in the master bedroom beneath a sheet. Andrea was taken into custody.\n\n**Background**\n\nAndrea was born Andrea Kennedy on 2 July  1964, in Houston, Texas. She was the youngest of five siblings in a stable Catholic family home. Though she suffered from bulimia and depression as a teenager Andrea succeeded academically, graduating as valedictorian before in 1986 achieving a degree nursing. She worked for several years at a cancer treatment centre.\n\nIn 1989 Andrea met Russell “Rusty” Yates, who she married in 1993. Soon afterwards Andrea quit nursing to become a full time housewife and mother, with the couple saying they would have as many children as \"nature would allow\". The couple had five children between 1994 and 2000 - four sons and one daughter. However, Andrea struggled with her mental health.\n\n**The \"cult\"**\n\nReligion became an increasing focus of Andrea's life after meeting Rusty. Rusty was a follower of preacher Michael Woroniecki, who led what is sometimes described as a cult. Rusty states that he and Andrea were in regular contact with Woroniecki who, for example, posted cassette tapes to the couple of his teachings for them to listen to.\n\n&gt;Former followers of Woroniecki who are interviewed in the docuseries and refer to themselves as “survivors” allege that Woroniecki exerted control through sermons, handwritten letters, and cassette tapes sent by mail, presenting himself as a spiritual authority.\n\nFormer followers describe Woroniecki's teachings as being informed by rigid doctrine, fear, and isolation. Woroniecki profoundly shaped the Yates family’s worldview and, it is claimed, his teachings likely intensified Andrea’s mental illness. \n\n**Mental illness**\n\nAndrea’s mental health deteriorated after the birth of her children, particularly following the birth of son Luke in 1999 when Rusty found Andrea in a catatonic state holding a knife to her own neck. On another occassion Andrea overdosed on pills. Andrea was hospitalized and diagnosed with  postpartum depression. With treatment, including anti-psychotic drug Haldol, Andrea initially improved but by the end of 1999, against medical advice but with the support of Rusty, stopped taking her medication.\n\nIn July 1999, Andrea had a nervous breakdown during which she attempted suicide twice and requires and two psychiatric hospitalizations. She was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Dr. Eileen Starbranch, testified that she urged Andrea and Rusty not to have any more children, as it would \"guarantee future psychotic depression.\"\n\nHowever, despite the warning of psychiatrists, the couple conceived their fifth child Mary around seven weeks after Andrea was discharged from hospital. Following Mary's birth in November 2000 and the death of her father in March 2001, Andrea’s condition worsened. She experienced hallucinations and believed the devil was inside her. These beliefs appear to have been reinforced by the teachings of Woroniecki, for example in a letter Andrea received from Rachel Woroniecki, Michael’s wife, at the time which read;\n\n&gt;“I pray for you Andrea. For you, Rusty and your family. I know things are not the way you would like to be. I’ve seen many women just continually put off their salvation in Jesus. Jesus knows how weak you are, how weak and vulnerable. I know you’re frustrated, Andrea. You’re accountable for these children. You can change them. There would be a day when it’s too late. Don’t look to Rusty, look to Jesus. If you allow Satan to come in and still be understanding, the consequences will be tragic. Love and Jesus, Rachel.”\n\nAndrea stopped taking medication, stopped feeding baby Mary, mutilated herself and read the Bible constantly. She was hospitalised, treated and, on 1 April 2001, released. On 3 May 2001 filled the bathtub in the middle of the day, planning to drown the children that day but changing her mind. She was hospitalised the next day, with doctors assuming she had intended to drown herself.\n\n**The murders**\n\nAndrea was released again by 20 June 2001 and living back at the family home. Rusty left for work that morning, leaving Andrea alone to watch the children despite specific instructions from her doctors that she must be supervised around the clock. Rusty's mother, Dora, was due to arrive an hour later. In that hour alone with her children, Andrea drowned all five of them, one by one.\n\nPaul, Luke, and John were killed first one by one and laid under a sheet on Andrea’s bed. She next drowned Mary, who remained floating in the tub when Noah came in and asked what was wrong with her. Noah ran, but was caught and drowned too. Andrea left Noah floating in the water, and placed Mary in the bed in her brother John's arms. She then called the police and Rusty, telling him to come home straight away.\n\n**Trials**\n\n&gt;Andrea Yates was charged with five counts of capital murder and went to trial in 2002. Prosecutors argued that, despite her documented mental illness, she understood that her actions were legally wrong. As part of that argument, they emphasized that Andrea waited until she was alone with the children before committing the killings and then contacted authorities afterward, which they claimed demonstrated awareness and intent.\n\n&gt;The defense maintained that Andrea was not guilty by reason of insanity, presenting extensive medical records and psychiatric testimony documenting severe postpartum psychosis. According to the defense, Andrea was suffering from persistent delusions and believed that killing her children was the only way to save them from eternal damnation. \n\n&gt;Rusty Yates supported the defense throughout the trial, repeatedly stating that Andrea’s actions were the result of untreated mental illness rather than criminal intent. Despite the evidence presented, the jury rejected the insanity defense. Andrea Yates was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with eligibility for parole after 40 years.\n\n&gt;In 2005, Yates’ conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Appeals. The reversal centered on false testimony given by prosecution expert Dr. Park Dietz, who claimed during the trial that an episode of Law &amp; Order had aired depicting a woman who drowned her children and was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecution used this claim to suggest Andrea may have fabricated her defense after watching the episode.\n\n&gt;It was later confirmed that no such episode existed, and Dietz chalked the error up to his own incorrect recollection. The appellate court ruled that the inaccurate testimony was materially misleading and could have influenced the jury’s decision, violating Andrea Yates’ right to a fair trial.\n\nAndrea was retried in 2006 and, on 26 July 2006, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity. She was committed to a state psychiatric hospital rather than being released, and was initially placed in a high-security psychiatric facility. She was later transferred to the Kerrville State Hospital, a maximum-security psychiatric center. Andrea remains at Kerrville and is eligible for periodic reviews regarding her confinement. However, she has consistently declined to seek release and voluntarily chosen to stay under psychiatric care.\n\n\n**Pictures**\n\n\n\n1. The grave of the Yates children.\n\n\n2.

    "text": "Best AI Visibility Tools / Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) in 2026: who each tool is for + pros/cons\nI’ve been doing GEO lately (trying to fix my own AI visibility + citations), so I tested a bunch of AI visibility tools. Not gonna do a big \"framework\" post, just the practical summary: who each tool is for + the real pros/cons.\n\nOne quick note: GEO / AI visibility tools still feel kinda early. A lot of them are great at showing data… but not all of them help you turn that data into \"okay, what do I do next?\"\n\n# 1) Profound\n\n**Who it’s for:** Bigger teams, bigger budget, someone on the team actually likes dashboards + analysis.\n\n* **Pros:** Deep monitoring and analysis. Feels more enterprise / research-grade. Great if you want long-term tracking and reporting for stakeholders.\n* **Cons:** Pricey, and you still need your own workflow to turn insights into actions. Otherwise, you just stare at charts of your visibility going up or down.\n\n# 2) Scrunch\n\n**Who it’s for:** People who want a more \"brand visibility in AI/search\" viewpoint, not just raw counts.\n\n* **Pros:** Nice for visibility trends and broader brand presence framing. Good for internal updates / direction.\n* **Cons:** If your goal is specifically to push citations up *today*, you’ll probably still need to build the execution playbook yourself.\n\n# 3) Otterly\n\n**Who it’s for:** Beginners or small teams who just want a baseline quickly: \"are we showing up at all?\"\n\n* **Pros:** Easy to start, low friction, good for getting a baseline running fast.\n* **Cons:** Easy to get stuck at \"watching numbers move.\" It won’t magically tell you *how* to earn more citations, just that you don't have them.\n\n# 4) Peec\n\n**Who it’s for:** Similar to Otterly—baseline monitoring without too much complexity.\n\n* **Pros:** Straightforward, good for getting visibility tracking running without a big setup.\n* **Cons:** If you expect it to answer \"what should we publish + where should we publish it,\" you’ll still need another layer of process or tooling.\n\n# 5) PromptWatch\n\n**Who it’s for:** Teams that are very prompt-centric (you maintain prompt libraries, you care about prompt-level monitoring and management).\n\n* **Pros:** Stronger fit if prompts are an actual asset you manage and iterate on.\n* **Cons:** It’s more on the monitoring/management side—content strategy + distribution + citation wins usually come from somewhere else.\n\n# 6) GenRankEngine\n\n**Who it’s for:** Founders/Devs who are tired of \"0% visibility\" and want a debugger, not just a dashboard.\n\n* **Pros:** This one felt the most actionable for \"fixing\" the problem. Instead of just saying \"You are invisible,\" it runs a \"displacement check\" to show you exactly *which* competitor is stealing your slot and *why* (e.g., \"They are mentioned in this specific Reddit thread and you aren't\"). It focuses heavily on the technical fixes (Schema, specific citation sources).\n* **Cons:** It’s strictly utilitarian. It doesn't have the prettiest enterprise charts like Profound. It’s built for people who want to execute, not present to a board.\n\n# 7) Wellows / AirOps\n\n**Who it’s for:** You already know what to do, you just want to produce + ship faster.\n\n* **Pros:** Great for scaling output and workflows.\n* **Cons:** They’re usually not \"AI visibility monitoring tools\" by themselves. You still need monitoring/attribution from elsewhere.",

    "text": "Add Markdown Table Support to TickTick Notes\n**Hey TickTick team and community!**\n\nI've been using TickTick for years and it's become an essential part of my productivity workflow. The ability to capture tasks, notes, and ideas in one place is fantastic. However, there's one feature that I believe would significantly enhance the notes experience - **native Markdown table support**.\n\n# Why Tables Matter\n\nTables are a fundamental way to organize information:\n\n* **Project planning** \\- timelines, milestones, responsibilities\n* **Comparison matrices** \\- features, pros/cons, pricing\n* **Data tracking** \\- habits, expenses, progress logs\n* **Structured notes** \\- meeting notes, research, documentation\n\nRight now, when I need a table, I have to either:\n\n* Use a separate app (Notion, Obsidian, etc.) and lose context\n* Create messy workarounds with code blocks or spacing\n\n# Current Limitations\n\nThe TickTick Markdown parser currently doesn't render standard Markdown tables:\n\n    | Feature | Status | Priority |\n    |---------|--------|----------|\n    | Tables  | Missing | High     |\n    | Mobile  | Partial | Medium   |\n\nThis renders as raw text instead of a formatted table.\n\n# What I'm Requesting\n\n**Full Markdown table support across all platforms:**\n\n1. Rendering of standard Markdown table syntax\n2. Support for basic formatting inside cells (bold, italic, links)\n3. Proper display on mobile apps (iOS/Android)\n4. Editing capabilities (either raw markdown or WYSIWYG)\n\nThis is standard Markdown - supported by GitHub, Reddit, Discord, Notion, Obsidian, and virtually every modern note-taking app.\n\n# Why This Matters for TickTick Users\n\n* **All-in-one workflow** \\- No need to switch apps for tabular data\n* **Better task context** \\- Keep related tables directly with tasks/projects\n* **Knowledge base** \\- TickTick could serve as a more complete second brain\n* **Power users** \\- Advanced users expect Markdown to work fully\n\n# Examples of Use Cases\n\n**Project roadmap:**\n\n    | Q1 2026 | Feature | Owner | Status |\n    |---------|---------|-------|--------|\n    | Jan     | Auth    | Alex  | Done   |\n    | Feb     | Tables  | Team  | In Prog|\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n    | Tool    | Pros | Cons |\n    |---------|------|------|\n    | TickTick| Fast | No tables |\n    | Notion  | Rich | Heavy |\n\n# Alternatives Considered (and why they fall short)\n\n* **Code blocks** \\- Don't render as actual tables, hard to read\n* **External apps** \\- Break workflow, context switching\n* **Images of tables** \\- Not searchable, not editable\n* **Spreadsheets** \\- Overkill for quick notes\n\n# Technical Feasibility\n\nMarkdown table rendering is well-established:\n\n* Open source libraries exist (marked, markdown-it, etc.)\n* No proprietary format needed - standard CommonMark\n* Mobile-friendly with responsive design\n* Backward compatible - existing notes unaffected\n\n# Who Else Wants This?\n\nIf you'd love to see table support in TickTick notes, please **upvote and comment** with your use cases!\n\nLet the TickTick team know this matters to the community.",

    "text": "Looking for AI Visibility Tools that Aren’t Crazy Expensive\nHey everyone,\n\nI’m trying to find a good AI visibility tool for my agency without getting locked into a huge annual bill.\n\nWe already use Semrush, but their AI Toolkit ends up being around $1,200 extra just to get data for a single domain, which feels like a lot to commit to before we even know if it is worth it. Eventually our plan is to have clients cover those costs, but first we want something on a month to month basis so we can test and see what kind of insights actually move the needle.\n\nI’ve seen Peec AI pop up online, but all the videos and reviews I’ve found seem sponsored or vague. Has anyone actually used that one or other tools that give solid visibility insights without the big upfront cost?\n\nWould love to hear what’s worked for you and what you would recommend for trying out before committing long term.",

    "text": "What should AI search look like in practice for local businesses (especially real estate)?\nHi! After going through what feels like a million subreddits, I think I might be in the best spot for this. I’m a real estate agent in Washington state (western Washington but not the Seattle area).  I’m somewhat tech savvy and have some experience with marketing, so I’ve been trying to wrap my head around how ai search (aeo/geo/whatever you want to call it, ai answers, etc.) actually applies to a local service business like mine, especially since the area is so saturated with agents. \n\nthe things I THINK I should be focusing on are:\n\n\\- showing up when people ask tools like chatgpt questions about moving, neighborhoods, VA loans, first-time buyers, local first-time buyer home programs etc.  \n\\- structuring content in a way that makes sense for AI answers, not just google \n\nI have been thinking about trying out tools like airops or similar platforms (or just building my own automations tbh) to help with content structure and not blindly generating stuff. I also want to see if anyone with smaller local businesses, who do not have a large budget, are having success with their ai search visibility efforts.  Are you focusing on FAQs, local content, reviews, or something else? does using social media or youtube to help with this?  Are you using any tools or are you just doing trial and error at this point? My website is hosted by my company, so I cannot completely optimize it the way I think I should be able to, so I am also considering building out my own site and hosting it externally so that I have more control over what can be edited.  \n\nas of January 1, 2026 Washington state also will be applying sales tax to digital advertising ( Google Ads), so I am just trying to think of additional ways to be productive, use my money in the best way for my business, but also...do things right?

You stop being free psychologically and socially.\n* People become less willing to: \\*say the unpopular thing, \\*try the weird thing, \\*join the controversial group, \\*be early, wrong, or experimental.\n* That’s not theory; it’s basic human risk-management.\n* This is the mechanism behind: \\*less dissent, \\*less innovation, \\*more conformity, \\*more “playing it safe.”\n\n*“That so few now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time.” (Mill) 1859*\n\n“Big Brother is watching you.” (Orwell) (he’s describing the psychology: internal self-policing.)\n\n**2) “Nothing to hide” is the wrong frame (and it’s how surveillance wins)**\n\n* When someone says: “If I didn’t do anything wrong, why should I care?” they’re assuming privacy is about hiding wrongdoing.\n* Privacy is actually about protecting normal human goods that democracy requires:\n\nA) You don’t control future interpretations\n\nWhat’s “fine” today can be “suspect” tomorrow (new laws, new politics, new moral panics, new definitions of extremism, new enforcement priorities). Your past data doesn’t update itself with context.\n\nB) The Flock systems (etc) do not account for context: A license-plate hit, a face match, or a location trace — these can be true and still misleading: You were nearby, not involved. You were present, not participating. You knew someone, you weren’t part of their thing.\n\nC) You don’t control error rates or consequences: Even low error rates at population scale create lots of false positives. And the cost of sorting it out is usually paid by the citizen, not the system.\n\nD) You don’t control who gets access later: Subpoenas, contractor access, data brokers, breaches, insider abuse. “Clean hands” doesn’t stop leakage.\n\nSo the correct reply is: “I care because it turns ordinary life into permanent evidence that can be reinterpreted, misclassified, or weaponized later—by people I didn’t elect, for reasons I didn’t consent to.”\n\n**3) Surveillance inevitably expands beyond its original purpose (function creep)**\n\nAlmost all systems start with a narrow justification: stolen cars, porch pirates, “public safety,” “just in emergencies.”\n\nBut once the infrastructure exists: expanding use becomes cheap, saying no becomes politically costly, every new problem gets mapped onto the existing tool. This is why the danger is structural: capability drives use.\n\n**“The loss of freedom is rarely dramatic; it is usually the slow erosion of many small liberties.” (Shklar)**\n\n**4) It flips the relationship between citizen and power. In a free society (as a default ideal): scrutiny follows suspicion, the state must justify intrusion.**\n\nIn a surveillance society: watching is default, privacy becomes the exception you must “earn.”\n\nThat’s a major inversion, even if nobody is being openly oppressive.\n\n“He who is subjected to a field of visibility… makes the constraints of power play spontaneously upon himself.” (Foucault)\n\nThis is the heart of it: surveillance doesn’t just catch behavior; it produces safer, quieter, more compliant behavior.\n\n**5) It creates one-way transparency: institutions see you; you can’t see them**\n\nDemocracy requires the public to be able to contest power. Surveillance increases information asymmetry:\n\ninstitutions can observe, profile, predict, preempt,\n\ncitizens can’t see how they’re scored, flagged, or categorized.\n\nThat makes:\n\nwhistleblowing riskier, organizing riskier, corruption safer, accountability harder.\n\n“Seeing like a state is seeing society in a way that makes it legible, and therefore controllable.” (Scott)\n\n**6) It degrades trust and civic life**\n\nHigh-trust societies don’t need as much monitoring; low-trust societies do. Ubiquitous surveillance pushes you toward low-trust norms:\n\npeople assume records can be used against them, people assume others are reporting, people behave defensively.\n\nTrust gets replaced by enforcement.\n\nAnd civic participation suffers when it feels like you’re leaving a permanent footprint.\n\n**7) It makes democracy more brittle, not more stable**\n\nSurveillance often produces “order,” but it’s the kind that suppresses feedback.\n\nDemocracies stay healthy through:\n\nopen disagreement, error-correction, public pressure that can vent, reform before rupture.\n\nSurveillance discourages the early, healthy forms of dissent, so pressure builds later, underground, polarized, and explosive.\n\n“The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction no longer exists.” (Arendt)\n\nArendt’s point connects here: when people are isolated and cautious, and public life loses trust, societies become easier to manipulate and harder to correct.\n\n**8) The practical “Ring / Flock / face recognition” questions**\n\nWho owns the footage/data? Who can access it (company employees, contractors, partners)? Who can subpoena it? How long is it stored? Can it be combined with other data (location, purchases, social graphs)? What happens when definitions of “suspicious” change? What happens after a breach?\n\nThe point isn’t about paranoia. It’s governance: you’re building infrastructure you don’t control.\n\n**9) The trade you’re actually making (and why it’s not neutral)**\n\nEven if it reduces some crime in some contexts, that doesn’t answer whether it’s worth the systemic cost.\n\n**“Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” (Benjamin Franklin)**\n\n**A short version you can say out loud**\n\n“‘Nothing to hide’ treats privacy like it’s only for criminals. That’s wrong. Privacy is what lets normal people speak, experiment, associate, and dissent without creating permanent evidence that can be reinterpreted later. Mass surveillance changes behavior even without abuse: people self-censor and play it safe. And once the infrastructure exists, it expands—because it’s efficient. Over time, it flips the relationship between citizens and power: institutions gain one-way visibility and control, while people become legible and manageable. That makes democracy quieter but more brittle.”\n\nSurveillance states are not incompatible with elections. They are incompatible with meaningful freedom.\n\nThey do not abolish democracy — they hollow it out.\n\nYou still vote. You still speak. You still choose.\n\nBut you choose inside a system that:\n\n* Knows you better than you know it\n* Nudges you before you decide\n* Filters what you see\n* Scores what you do\n* And quietly narrows the range of “acceptable” selves.\n\nAt that point, democracy becomes a user interface on top of a control system.\n\nIt looks the same. It feels similar. But the causal power has moved elsewhere. That is the real danger. Not oppression. Not tyranny. But management replacing self-government.\n\nAnd most people won’t even notice the difference — because it will feel safe, smooth, and convenient.\n\nUntil there’s something you want to do, say, think, or become… that the system doesn’t like.\n\nThat’s when you find out whether you’re free.",

    "text": "Almost everything you ever wanted to know?\n[Set realistic expectations]\nThis is a malady that surpasses current medical science. Diagnosis and treatment are going to involve a lot of chance. Not to sugar coat it. A lot of treatments are not much different than chemo to treat cancer, a bit of luck and crossing fingers involved, and no guarantees that if you fix something, the fix will last. This is literally going to be a choose your own adventure game.\n\n\n[What does science say]\n----------------------\n[Where people go wrong]\n- Did you Google and read something from a foot doctor’s office? Wrong.\n- Did you find it on some WebMD generic medical advice site? Wrong.\n- Did you learn something from a YouTube video, or a manufacturer of an orthopedic or other product? Wrong.\n\n[The only source of truth]\nThe only source of truth is peer-reviewed medical science articles. You find them by Googling: “Mortons neuroma treatment nih”.\n\n\n[First, diagnosis]\n-----------------\n[Imaging limitations]\n- MRI or ultrasound both have a &gt;10% chance to not show the neuroma.\n- Yes, that means you could get ultrasound and MRI and none of that even sees the neuroma.\n- Neither is necessarily more accurate.\n- stating the obvious: ultrasound in your foot docs office takes 5 minutes. MRI is a lot more time consuming &amp; complicated. Neither is more accurate.\n\n[Physical localization]\nDoctors can attempt to locate the pain location with their fingers by literally pressing on the bottom of your foot until they find exactly where the pain is. This is not fun, but possibly it is the most idiot-proof way to locate the neuroma.\n\n[Where it probably is]\n- 3rd or 2nd (not always on the 3rd).\n- You can have more than 1.\n- You can have one on each foot.\n\n\n[Second, doctors]\n----------------\n[Do not blindly trust your doctor]\nYou absolutely must not blindly trust your doc. Your doc does not know all the info. Their understanding is outdated, incomplete, biased, or any combination of those. They will cause you unnecessary suffering, waste months of your time, and expose you to risks without disclosing them to you. They will flat out lie and state things that are not medically accurate.\n\n[Requirements and questions]\n- Your doc must have an ultrasound machine in their office.\n- Your doc must be confident which metatarsal and where the issue is. They better not be guessing. Ask them.\n- If they say “usually” or “generally,” drill deeper. Ask what you can do to be more certain.\n\n[Be willing to fire your doctor]\nYou must be willing to fire your doc if you catch them in a lie. Immediately find another. Ideally, you should line up 3. I had to fire 4 in a row.\n\n[Why this matters]\nSome treatment options only give you a few tries. If you waste a try from a crappy doc, you do not get that back. You wanted that try. Sometimes you waste a chance at a better, more accurate application of a treatment. Sometimes you waste the try because the doc literally applied it in the wrong place. This will make more sense in the treatment process below.\n\nExample: a doc that's not sure where it's located uses a non ultrasound guided process to give you a steroid injection. That was a complete waste.\n\n\n[Third, lifestyle adjustments]\n-----------------------------\n[Shoes]\nSee [Shoes!!!!!] section below.\n\n[Hobbies and work]\nLook, you have a nerve issue. It is aggravated when you walk. Perhaps it is caused by incorrectly sized footwear or a certain activity. You have a decision to make.\n\n- Will you keep behaving normally, exposing your foot to more impacts?\n- Will you continue wearing shoes that are not 100% certainly wide enough, so you are certain they are not further aggravating or worsening the issue?\n- Do you make huge painful temporary sacrifices in your lifestyle to keep off your feet and give them rest (or merely prevent further aggravation of the problem)?\n\nThis is all your choice. Science does not tell whether it makes a difference or not. It is your call.\n\n[Support and logistics]\nDo you have someone that can help you live for a few months? Stairs, curbs, driving, walking on concrete, these can all be very, very difficult as you navigate this process.\n\nIf you have an old car with a high pedal, or especially a truck or something, do you have a backup car or the option for rideshare? Depending on your journey and proximity to your doc, driving may not be fun.\n\n\n[Organization]\n--------------\nYou need to keep track of what is being diagnosed. Was it diagnosed in your 3rd metatarsal but then later it is diagnosed in your 2nd? Remember how imaging is not accurate all the time, and how some docs will literally just make a guess based on some generic, nonspecific physical test.\n\n\n[Travel]\n--------\nTwo treatment options that may apply to your journey of healing will almost certainly require travel. I am talking plane tickets and hotel rooms. Do not freak out or go down a rabbit hole, this is just planting the seed so you are not shocked if you end up there.\n\n\n[Treatment pathway]\n-------------------\n[Remember: choose your own adventure]\nAsk these questions every single time, no matter what you are having done to you:\n\n- Odds of success\n- Odds it works but does not last\n- Odds there are complications, what those complications are, and how you fix those complications\n- Afterwards, will you need crutches or a boot?\n- How long until you can walk a quarter mile on a concrete sidewalk, go running, climb stairs without a handrail, etc. Be very specific about the activities you wish to return to. Do not generalize here.\n- Numbness. We are working with nerves here, always ask about numbness possibilities.\n\n\n[Option one: Steroid injections]\n-------------------------------\n- Highest odds of success are ultrasound-guided steroid injections.\n- You get three tries, and after each try you normally need to wait 4 weeks before you attempt another try.\n- So that is 12 weeks to play this card.\n\n[Summary]\n- Success outcome: low\n- Pain and $: low\n- Time: 4 to 12 weeks\n- Risks: your feet have something called fat pads. There is a very small chance the steroid dissolves the fat pads and causes other issues, or actually worsens your symptoms.\n\nThought bubble: If you skip ahead you might always find yourself wondering what would have happened if you tried this step first.\n\n\n[Option two: Alcohol injections]\n-------------------------------\n[Prerequisites]\nGenerally only try this after having tried the three steroid shots first. You get about three tries. I am not sure about the time between each attempt.\n\n[Summary]\n- Success outcome: very low\n- Pain and money: moderate\n- Time: TBD\n\n[Additional details]\nThis process is more painful than the steroid shots, and the science is pretty clear-cut that the odds of success here are so low it is almost certainly a waste of your time.\n\n[My recommendation]\nSkip. Your foot doc will probably recommend this step. But... you might find it humorous that as soon as you tell them the information I just said above, they'll agree and say it's a great idea to skip it, that they don't see good outcomes themselves.\n\n\n[Option three: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation]\n------------------------------------------------------------\n[Prerequisites]\nNone, you can skip directly to this step based on your own preferences. I am not clear on this, but I believe you only get to choose one of these two options, you do not get to try both.  \n\nThese guys recommended RAF: www.aens.us. But they also seem against both overall. \n\n[Cost]\nModerate, you will be paying cash for this, insurance does not cover it.\n\n[Travel]\nYou have only a handful of doctors that apply these treatments spread across the country, so unless you are lucky you are going to be flying to get treated. These few practicing physicians are familiar with patients flying to see them for your exact issue, so do not be intimidated by that.\n\n[Comparing cryo vs RFA]\nThis is really on you to decide. The reason insurance does not cover this is because it is not officially endorsed by the greater community. If you look up peer-reviewed science articles you will see success rates as high as 80% depending on what you read. \n\nBut, why doesn't insurance cover it? No idea. The closest factual evidence I can find is that there's a specialized association of nerve doctors and they released an official statement saying they don't condone either of these surgeries. (https://www.aens.us).  My personal take is that these treatments are a lot like the SharkBite fitting used in plumbing home repair.  There are millions of people saying they work great but if you went to an official plumbing organization the general consensus they're absolutely not acceptable.\n\n[Risks]\nIf you end up getting a neurectomy later, using either of these options may increase chance of complications with that surgery. \n\n[Recovery time]\nI do not know what to trust about what I read online. All I can recommend is that if you choose one of these options and select a doctor, call back several times and ask detailed questions about best case and worst case recovery time, and your full ability to return to daily activity. Call Tuesday &amp; you get somebody busy and uninterested, and try Thursday you get somebody talkative and helpful.\n\n“He will walk out of the office after the treatment” could still mean “you will still be limping around the house 3 weeks later.”\n“You will be able to return to your daily activities after 1 week” might be a best estimate, or may only apply to somebody that works in an office 12 hours a day and the farthest they walk is to the milk section in the grocery store.\n\nHave the courage to ask your doctor worst case recovery time, and clarify your personal physical activity and foot usage.\n\n[Locations - just a few I know, there are more]\nCryo:\n- Arizona\n- Massachusetts \n\nRadiofrequency:\n- Houston, TX\n\n[Personal observations on the three above]\nMesa, AZ: these guys almost seem off the radar. They do not seem to market themselves well online or by responding to Reddit posts, it seems to be entirely word of mouth. The physician has been doing this a long time, and his costs are as low as $600 per treatment cash as of 2025. Their office is casual and old school. My first-hand experience is that this provider claims to have been involved in the development and refinement of the cryo process itself. Their location is 40+ minutes drive away from the Phoenix airport.\n\nMassachusetts: this location has a heavy online presence. They actively respond to Reddit posts and they have a lot of online “educational” material that attempts to funnel you to their website and treatment. Make what you will of that. I found it fascinating, the stark difference between the attitudes of these two providers. Perhaps you have your own intuition about which to pick.\n\nRFA Houston, TX: TBD. My personal, perhaps clumsy experience was I had trouble locating these guys and their phone response was not inspiring.\n\n\n[Option final: Neurectomy]\n--------------------------\nThis has two options: from the top or bottom of the foot? Both have pros and cons. Current science says pick a doc you trust and go with what they are experienced in. My personal recommendation is interview and research. This is nerve surgery. This is not a default specialty of a foot doc. You need them to hit a home run.\n\n[Summary]\n- Cost: low, insurance coverage yes\n- Recovery time: high, walking boot after\n- Risk: &gt;10% chance of complications. Oh, did your doc underplay that? Google “neurectomy nerve stump”. And Google “podiatric surgery lawsuits” to get a general sense of foot surgery outcome risks.\n\n\n[PT]\n----\nThere are some anecdotal stories, but I do not see scientific findings showing that PT alone is going to fix this issue. Maybe improve it dramatically?\n\nIf insurance is going to cover this, I recommend you do it. Why? When you have surgery there is something called prehab. The idea is you prepare your body to be in the best shape possible so that it can handle recovering itself after surgery. In the small chance you end up needing surgery, this will set you up for a great successful outcome and you started early.\n\nAs you work through your process journey, and depending on your life situation and the footwear you have available, your gait may be temporarily and dramatically disturbed as you shift weight off the front part of your feet, or overload weight to one knee versus the other.\n\n\n[Shoes!!!!!]\n------------\nWe are going to talk about width, length, shoe size, midfoot location, toebox height, and sole material.\n\n[Services to consider]\nIf you are going to take time to search for the holy grail of shoes to either ease your healing journey or prevent this from happening once you come out the other side, I highly recommend you invest in one or both of these services: Amazon Prime and REI.\n\nRealistically, you are not going to read up on shoes during a few lunch breaks and make a few stops in stores and find the perfect shoe.\n\n[Example of why it is hard]\n- You went in the store and that shoe felt great and wide enough.\n- After you get out of the store and you have walked a few hundred feet on the concrete sidewalk, you notice your feet hurt like crazy.\n- After you get home and put on your toe spacers, you realize your feet are wider than you thought, and they are actually being scrunched by the shoe.\n- After you get home and put on thicker socks, you realize the shoe was still too narrow and scrunching your toes.\n- After you get home and lace up the shoe and use it frequently, you slowly end up lacing it slightly differently and shifting your weight more naturally. You realize that although the shoe was wide enough during the initial test fit, in day-to-day use your foot has shifted to a different location (perhaps further towards the heel), or the shoe was narrower further toward the side, which smashes your toe up against what would otherwise have been a wide enough shoe.\n\n[Great Resource]\nRunrepeat.com\n[What to look for]\n- Toe box width\n- Toe box taper\n- Forefoot stack\n- Drop\n- Sole rigidity\n\n[Your shoes probably caused this]\nStrong chance that your shoes caused this. Too narrow shoes, or you wore the wrong size.\n\nAlmost every shoe manufactured in this country is designed incorrectly to match human foot anatomy. Four different docs independently shared that as their opinion.\n\n[Solution: wider shoes]\nYes, but how?\n\n[Larger shoe size?]\nMaybe. Every size you increase increases the width of the shoe, but it also increases the length. Longer shoes start to put the arch and narrow part of the shoe too far off, mismatching your foot. You are also going to have, in my opinion, a clown shoe effect if you start sticking the shoe more than 2 inches beyond your big toe.\n\n[Wide shoe brands]\nAltra, Topo, etc. These manufacturers specifically manufacture shoes to match the anatomy of a human foot. It is obvious from looking at the bottom of the shoes how different they are.\n\nBut that does *not* mean they are wide enough. Not every size 10 from a wide shoe manufacturer is the same width at the same place in the shoe. Some are equally as wide, but the taper angle as it goes toward the front tip is at a different curvature or aggressiveness. That can make one squish your toes while the other does not.\n\n[How to test the width]\nYou might have come across the trick where you take out the sole of the shoe and rest your foot on it to see if the shoe is wide enough. That is not super reliable. Some of the items below show why.\n\n[Sitting vs walking width]\nYou can sit on the edge of a stool and put your foot down on top of a shoe sole and it might look like it is fitting within the sole width. But if you stand up and lean forward and put weight on your foot, your foot may spread wider, your toes may splay wider (especially your big toe or pinky), and all of a sudden that shoe is constricting the width of your toes.\n\n[Forefoot stack]\nSome shoes have a very thin forefoot stack (the thickness of the shoe below where your neuroma pain is probably occurring). The shoe may fit you wonderfully, but because of the thinness and flex in that part of the shoe, it might not be something you can use in the early stages of your recovery process.\n\n[More on forefoot stack height]\nIt is my hypothesis that buying shoes with a high forefoot stack height (20 to 30 mm) can make a big difference in temporarily alleviating your neuroma pain. This is not going to solve your problem, but it could buy you time or an easier recovery journey.\n\n[Shoe drop]\nIn a perfect world you will look up the shoe drop of your current footwear and make sure that any substitute fit where you swap to permanently or temporarily is not a drastic change from that. If it is, prepare for the fact that changing the drop suddenly is not supposed to be easy for your body to adapt to. When you combine that with potentially changed gait mechanics or weight shifting behavior.from your neuroma, it could be making things more complicated than you realize. I am not saying do not do it, just go in eyes wide open.\n\n[Midfoot length]\nOk, so it's the right length, right width (even with toe spacers or thick socks), and after you laced it up to match how you normally lace it up. The sole is what you want, the drop is okay. But you forgot the midfoot.\n\nThe narrowest part of your shoe in the middle of your foot (midfoot) is not always where you think it is. Imagine you take the sole out of your shoe, lay it on the carpet, and set your foot on it. You notice your foot is more than wide enough to fit on top of the sole, so you determine the shoe is wide enough for your foot. When you put that sole back in the shoe and put your foot in, the midfoot built into that shoe (most likely the inner side, not the outer side) may push your foot sideways. Your foot is not centered on the sole like it was during your test, and lo and behold - it is still squishing your foot too narrow.\n\n[Toebox height]\nAnother gotcha, just as surprising as the midfoot shoe location. The sides of the toe box cloth as they come up from the bottom of the shoe- they may immediately start curving inwards. That sloped cloth will actually squish your toes inwards, narrower than the sole.\n\n\n[Gizmos]\n--------\n[Toe spacers]\nI find no risk, only upside potential.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence from people with neuromas, and from people in general, who swear by these. Depending on your interpretation of what internet testimonies say, this might be a good thing to adopt for your overall foot health anyway. \n\nTwo types: some have a loop around your pinky and big toe, some don't. \n\nSide sleepers: some online testimonies recommend that side sleepers who usually squish their feet inwards might have relief from sleeping with toe spacers.\n\n[Metatarsal pads]\nThree things to consider:\n- What are they made out of?\n- How thick are they?\n- Where do you put them on your foot?\n\nGeneral consensus from several foot doctors is those made out of felt.\nGeneral consensus is they need to be thick, a quarter of an inch or thicker.\n\nLocation: Go into your foot doctor’s office and work with them in person to figure out exactly where to place it. I was advised firsthand by an athletic physical therapist that placement is extremely precise. Being off by even a few millimeters, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\n\nThose could spread the metatarsals of your foot and alleviate your neuroma pain, but walking on a big pad in the middle of your foot can have other side effects. Go into this eyes wide open. You might come out the end of this healing journey only to realize you have other temporary quirks to work through, because when you remove those pads from your daily routine your foot is going to feel a little weird and unhappy.",

Reliability, low friction, and predictable behavior matter far more to me than ideology - free vs paid, open vs closed source, community popularity, or brand loyalty.\n\nThis comparison is based on **real-world daily usage**, not feature checklists or stress-testing edge cases.\n\nFor additional security separation, I also use **KeePassXC** to store the master credentials for Proton Pass, Bitwarden, and Dashlane. That setup allows me to evaluate password managers strictly on usability and reliability rather than vendor lock-in concerns.\n\n# Dashlane - Pros\n\n* **Polished, cohesive UI** The design feels mature and intentional. No visual clutter, no unnecessary animations, no constant micro-friction.\n* **No autofill zoom animation** A surprisingly big quality-of-life improvement coming from Bitwarden. Autofill is instant and non-distracting instead of visually jarring. One benefit of migrating to Dashlane is that I no longer need a custom userscript to disable Bitwarden’s unnecessary autofill zoom-out animation, which also allowed me to uninstall Tampermonkey again.\n* **Superior autofill reliability (for my usage)** Dashlane consistently detects login fields where Bitwarden frequently failed for me. I submitted multiple autofill bug reports to Bitwarden over several months - none were resolved during my usage period.\n* **iCloud login works correctly** Dashlane autofills both email and password on [icloud.com](http://icloud.com) in one step. Bitwarden and Proton Pass require manual interaction with the password field to complete the login.\n* **Searchable inline suggestions (with one caveat)** While Dashlane doesn’t support inline pre-typing like Proton Pass, it *does* allow searching directly inside the suggestion menu when the needed credential isn’t visible. This is something Bitwarden still lacks. Caveat: this inline search currently does **not** work for Google login pages, where suggestions are still limited to the visible list.\n* **Fast access to the web vault** One click on \"Open Web App\" directly from the extension. No manual URL typing, no forced re-login. This sounds small, but it adds up in daily use.\n* **Better password generator UX** The extension includes a password length slider. Bitwarden removed theirs in late 2024 and replaced it with step buttons, which is slower and more cumbersome for frequent use.\n* **Settings persistence and sync** Dashlane reliably saves extension preferences and syncs them across browsers. Bitwarden repeatedly reset my settings after browser profile refreshes or reinstalls.\n* **Smarter copy workflow** If a credential isn’t eligible for autofill, Dashlane presents a follow-up window after copying the username, allowing immediate password copying. Bitwarden closes the extension menu entirely, forcing an extra extension interaction.\n\n# Dashlane - Cons\n\n* Inline suggestions are limited to **20 credentials**\n* No option to **favorite or pin** logins\n\n# Perspective on password manager discourse\n\nI don’t choose tools based on ideology.\n\nWhether a password manager is:\n\n* free or paid\n* open or closed source\n\nis irrelevant to me if it fails at its **core job**.\n\nA free product does **not** earn immunity from criticism when it:\n\n* breaks autofill workflows\n* introduces UI friction\n* causes performance regressions\n* leaves long-standing bugs unresolved\n\nThe only hard red line for me is **security breaches**.  \nOutside of that, I use what works best for my needs - not what a community promotes or defends.\n\n# Why Dashlane was unexpected\n\nI’ve used and trialed nearly every major password manager:\n\n* Proton Pass\n* Bitwarden\n* 1Password\n* Keeper\n* NordPass\n* RoboForm\n* KeePassXC\n\nEvery single one eventually pushed me back into \"search mode\" due to:\n\n* autofill unreliability\n* UX friction\n* missing essentials\n* or accumulated daily annoyances\n\nDashlane was the last major option I hadn’t seriously evaluated.\n\nUnexpectedly, it’s the **first one that stopped the constant urge to look for an alternative**.\n\nThat alone says more than any feature comparison table.\n\n# On the Reddit Bitwarden community behavior (and why it matters)\n\nWhat ultimately pushed me to write this wasn’t just product differences - it was community behavior.\n\nThere is a recurring pattern where the Bitwarden subreddit and adjacent communities **attempt to impose Bitwarden as the default answer**, regardless of what the original poster is actually asking.\n\nA recent example from 2 days ago illustrates this perfectly.\n\n# The Question (summarized)\n\nA user asked for a Dashlane replacement and explicitly said they were considering:\n\n* NordPass\n* 1Password\n\nTheir **main requirement** was strong MFA support on the web.\n\nBitwarden was **never mentioned** by the OP.\n\n# The most upvoted answer - 11 upvotes atm\n\n&gt;\n\nThis comment:\n\n* Mentions Bitwarden first\n* Emphasizes free tier superiority\n* Uses absolute language - \"superior password manager\"\n* Frames alternatives as acceptable only after Bitwarden is endorsed\n* Ends with a loyalty signal\n\nIt doesn’t meaningfully address the OP’s main concern (MFA reliability), but that doesn’t matter.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it reinforces the dominant narrative:  \n**\"Bitwarden is the default correct answer.\"**\n\nOnce a product reaches that status, it no longer has to justify itself.\n\n# The Downvoted Comment\n\n&gt;\n\nThis comment:\n\n* Tried Bitwarden\n* Moved on\n* Explained why another product worked better *for them*\n* Was calm, respectful, and detailed\n\nAnd yet - 5 downvotes atm.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it violates an unspoken rule:\n\n* You **are** allowed to leave Dashlane\n* You **are** allowed to consider alternatives\n* You are **not** allowed to try Bitwarden and still choose something else\n\nThat’s the real issue.\n\n# This isn’t advice - It’s evangelism\n\nAt that point, the subreddit stops being:\n\n&gt;Let’s help users find the best tool for their needs\n\nand becomes:\n\n&gt;Let’s guide everyone toward the approved product\n\nVoting behavior stops reflecting:\n\n* relevance\n* accuracy\n* lived experience\n\nand starts reflecting:\n\n* alignment\n* conformity\n* brand loyalty\n\nThe NordPass comment wasn’t downvoted because it was wrong.  \nIt was downvoted because it **breaks the conversion funnel**.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nDashlane isn’t perfect by any means.\n\nBut so far, it has been **consistently reliable**, and reliability is what I value most in a password manager.\n\nIf Bitwarden meaningfully addressed:\n\n* autofill reliability\n* animation and UX friction\n* long-standing performance regressions\n\nI’d reconsider it.\n\nUntil then, I’d rather **pay for something that works predictably** than tolerate daily friction simply because a product is free, open source, or aggressively promoted by its community.",

    "text": "I Replaced My RAG System's Vector DB Last Week. Here's What I Learned About Vector Storage at Scale\n# The Context\n\nWe built a document search system using LlamaIndex \\~8 months ago. Started with Pinecone because it was simple, but at 50M embeddings the bill was getting ridiculous—$3,200/month and climbing.\n\nThe decision matrix was simple:\n\n* Cost is now a bottleneck (we're not VC-backed)\n* Scale is predictable (not hyper-growth)\n* We have DevOps capability (small team, but we can handle infrastructure)\n\n# The Migration Path We Took\n\n# Option 1: Qdrant (We went this direction)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Instant updates (no sync delays like Pinecone)\n* Hybrid search (vector + BM25 in one query)\n* Filtering on metadata is incredibly fast\n* Open source means no vendor lock-in\n* Snapshot/recovery is straightforward\n* gRPC interface for low latency\n* Affordable at any scale\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* You're now managing infrastructure\n* Didn't have great LlamaIndex integration initially (this has improved!)\n* Scaling to multi-node requires more ops knowledge\n* Memory usage is higher than Pinecone for same data size\n* Less battle-tested at massive scale (Pinecone is more proven)\n* Support is community-driven (not SLA-backed)\n\n**Costs:**\n\n* Pinecone: $3,200/month at 50M embeddings\n* Qdrant on r5.2xlarge EC2: $800/month\n* AWS data transfer (minimal): $15/month\n* RDS backups to S3: $40/month\n* Time spent migrating/setting up: \\~80 hours (don't underestimate this)\n* Ongoing DevOps cost: \\~5 hours/month\n\n# What We Actually Changed in LlamaIndex Code\n\nThis was refreshingly simple because LlamaIndex abstracts away the storage layer. Here's the before and after:\n\n**Before (Pinecone):**\n\n    from llama_index.vector_stores import PineconeVectorStore\n    from pinecone import Pinecone\n    \n    pc = Pinecone(api_key=\"your_api_key\")\n    pinecone_index = pc.Index(\"documents\")\n    \n    vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(pinecone_index=pinecone_index)\n    \n    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(\n        documents,\n        vector_store=vector_store,\n    )\n    \n    # Query\n    retriever = index.as_retriever()\n    results = retriever.retrieve(query)\n\n**After (Qdrant):**\n\n    from llama_index.vector_stores import QdrantVectorStore\n    from qdrant_client import QdrantClient\n    \n    # That's it. One line different.\n    client = QdrantClient(url=\"http://localhost:6333\")\n    vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(\n        client=client,\n        collection_name=\"my_documents\",\n        prefer_grpc=True  # Much faster than HTTP\n    )\n    \n    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(\n        documents,\n        vector_store=vector_store,\n    )\n    \n    # Query code doesn't change\n    retriever = index.as_retriever()\n    results = retriever.retrieve(query)\n\n**The abstraction actually works.** Your query code never changes. You only swap the vector store definition. This is why LlamaIndex is superior for flexibility.\n\n# Performance Changes\n\nHere's the data from our production system:\n\n|Metric|Pinecone|Qdrant|Winner|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P50 Latency|240ms|95ms|Qdrant|\n|P99 Latency|340ms|185ms|Qdrant|\n|Exact match recall|87%|91%|Qdrant|\n|Metadata filtering speed|&lt;50ms|&lt;30ms|Qdrant|\n|Vector size limit|8K|Unlimited|Qdrant|\n|Uptime (observed)|99.95%|99.8%|Pinecone|\n|Cost|$3,200/mo|$855/mo|Qdrant|\n|Setup complexity|5 minutes|3 days|Pinecone|\n\n**Key insight:** Qdrant is faster for search because it doesn't have to round-trip through SaaS infrastructure. Lower latency = better user experience.\n\n# The Gotchas We Hit (So You Don't Have To)\n\n# 1. Vectorize Updates Aren't Instant\n\nWith Pinecone, new documents showed up immediately in searches. With Qdrant:\n\n* Documents are indexed in &lt;500ms typically\n* But under load, can spike to 2-3 seconds\n* There's no way to force immediate consistency\n\n**Impact:** We had to add UI messaging that says \"Search results update within a few seconds of new documents.\"\n\n**Workaround:**\n\n    # Add a small delay before retrieving new docs\n    import time\n    \n    def index_and_verify(documents, vector_store, max_retries=5):\n        \"\"\"Index documents and verify they're searchable\"\"\"\n        vector_store.add_documents(documents)\n        \n        # Wait for indexing\n        time.sleep(1)\n        \n        # Verify at least one doc is findable\n        for attempt in range(max_retries):\n            results = vector_store.search(documents[0].get_content()[:50])\n            if len(results) &gt; 0:\n                return True\n            time.sleep(1)\n        \n        raise Exception(\"Documents not indexed after retries\")\n\n# 2. Backup Strategy Isn't Free\n\nPinecone backs up your data automatically. Now you own backups. We set up:\n\n* Nightly snapshots to S3: $40/month\n* 30-day retention policy\n* CloudWatch alerts if backup fails\n\n\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Daily Qdrant backup script\n    \n    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)\n    BACKUP_PATH=\"s3://my-backups/qdrant/backup_${TIMESTAMP}/\"\n    \n    curl -X POST http://localhost:6333/snapshots \\\n      -d '{\"collection_name\": \"my_documents\"}'\n    \n    # Wait for snapshot to complete\n    sleep 10\n    \n    # Move snapshot to S3\n    aws s3 cp /snapshots/ $BACKUP_PATH --recursive\n    \n    # Clean up old snapshots (&gt;30 days)\n    aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket my-backups --prefix qdrant/ | \\\n      jq '.Contents[] | select(.LastModified &lt; now - 30*24*3600)' | \\\n      xargs -I {} aws s3 rm s3://my-backups/{}\n\nNot complicated, but it's work.\n\n# 3. Network Traffic Changed Architecture\n\nAll your embedding models now communicate with Qdrant over the network. If you're:\n\n* **Batching embeddings:** Fine, network cost is negligible\n* **Per-query embeddings:** Latency can suffer, especially if Qdrant and embeddings are in different regions\n\n**Solution:** We moved embedding and Qdrant to the same VPC. This cut search latency 150ms.\n\n    # Bad: embeddings in Lambda, Qdrant in separate VPC\n    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()  # API call from Lambda\n    results = vector_store.search(embedding)  # Cross-VPC network call\n    \n    # Good: both in same VPC, or local embeddings\n    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n    # Local inference, no network call\n    results = vector_store.search(embedding)\n\n# 4. Memory Usage is Higher Than Advertised\n\nQdrant's documentation says it needs \\~1GB per 100K vectors. We found it was closer to 1GB per 70K vectors. At 50M, we needed 700GB RAM. That's an r5.2xlarge (\\~$4/hour).\n\n**Why?** Qdrant keeps indexes in memory for speed. There's no cold storage tier like some other systems.\n\n**Workaround:** Plan your hardware accordingly and monitor memory usage:\n\n    # Health check endpoint\n    import psutil\n    \n    def get_vector_db_health():\n        \"\"\"Check Qdrant health and memory\"\"\"\n        response = requests.get(\"http://localhost:6333/health\")\n        \n        # Also check system memory\n        memory = psutil.virtual_memory()\n        \n        if memory.percent &gt; 85:\n            send_alert(\"Qdrant memory above 85%\")\n        \n        return {\n            \"qdrant_status\": response.status_code == 200,\n            \"memory_percent\": memory.percent,\n            \"available_gb\": memory.available / (1024**3)\n        }\n\n# 5. Schema Evolution is Painful\n\nWhen you want to change how documents are stored (add new metadata, change chunking strategy), you have to:\n\n1. Stop indexing\n2. Export all vectors\n3. Re-process documents\n4. Re-embed if needed\n5. Rebuild index\n\nWith Pinecone, they handle this. With Qdrant, you manage it.\n\n    def migrate_collection_schema(old_collection, new_collection):\n        \"\"\"Migrate vectors and metadata to new schema\"\"\"\n        client = QdrantClient(url=\"http://localhost:6333\")\n        \n        # Scroll through old collection\n        offset = 0\n        batch_size = 100\n        \n        new_documents = []\n        \n        while True:\n            points, next_offset = client.scroll(\n                collection_name=old_collection,\n                limit=batch_size,\n                offset=offset\n            )\n            \n            if not points:\n                break\n            \n            for point in points:\n                # Transform metadata\n                old_metadata = point.payload\n                new_metadata = transform_metadata(old_metadata)\n                \n                new_documents.append({\n                    \"id\": point.id,\n                    \"vector\": point.vector,\n                    \"payload\": new_metadata\n                })\n            \n            offset = next_offset\n        \n        # Upsert to new collection\n        client.upsert(\n            collection_name=new_collection,\n            points=new_documents\n        )\n        \n        return len(new_documents)\n\n# The Honest Truth\n\n**If you're at &lt;10M embeddings:** Stick with Pinecone. The operational overhead of managing Qdrant isn't worth saving $200/month.\n\n**If you're at 50M+ embeddings:** Self-hosted Qdrant makes financial sense if you have 1-2 engineers who can handle infrastructure. The DevOps overhead is real but manageable.\n\n**If you're growing hyper-fast:** Managed is better. You don't want to debug infrastructure when you're scaling 10x/month.\n\n**Honest assessment:** Pinecone's product has actually gotten better in the last year. They added some features we were excited about, so this decision might not hold up as well in 2026. Don't treat this as \"Qdrant is objectively better\"—it's \"Qdrant is cheaper at our current scale, with tradeoffs.\"\n\n# Alternative Options We Considered (But Didn't Take)\n\n# Milvus\n\n**Pros:** Similar to Qdrant, more mature ecosystem, good performance **Cons:** Heavier resource usage, more complex deployment, larger team needed **Verdict:** Better for teams that already know Kubernetes well.

    "text": "GEO vs SEO: The Fundamental Shift in Search Engine Optimization in 2026\n## Preface: The Paradigm Shift from “Blue Links” to “Answer-First”\n\nIn the fields of digital marketing and content creation, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has long been the cornerstone of traffic acquisition. However, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, we are now standing at a historic turning point—the fundamental logic of search engines is being disrupted by **Generative Engines (GEs)**.\nThis transformation is not merely a technological upgrade; it represents a fundamental reshaping of the rules that govern content visibility.\n\nTraditional SEO aims to secure a spot among the top “blue links” on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) by optimizing keywords, improving page quality, and accumulating backlinks. At its core, this model revolves around **ranking**—a clear, trackable, and competitive position.\n\nToday, however, generative engines powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Google AI Overviews or Perplexity, are redefining the search experience. Search is shifting from a “list of links” to **direct answers**. Users no longer need to click through multiple websites to evaluate information; instead, they receive AI-generated summaries that synthesize, integrate, and cite multiple sources.\n\nAs a result, the traditional SEO objective of “ranking higher” is becoming fundamentally outdated.\n\nAccording to [research](https://generative-engines.com/GEO/) from institutions such as Princeton University and the Indian Institutes of Technology, generative engines present unprecedented challenges for content creators:\n\n&gt; “The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to a new paradigm of search engines that leverage generative models to collect and synthesize information in order to answer user queries. These generative engines (GEs), capable of producing accurate and personalized answers, are rapidly replacing traditional search engines and improving user experience.”\n\nTo address this shift, a new optimization paradigm has emerged: **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.\n\nRather than focusing on traditional rankings, GEO aims to increase the likelihood that content is **cited** or **mentioned** within AI-generated answers.\n\nThis is not simply an evolution of SEO—it is a fundamental rewrite of the rules of search optimization itself.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the New Visibility Framework\n\nBefore diving into GEO strategies, we must first address a fundamental question:\n**How is “visibility” measured in generative engines?**\n\n---\n\n## Visibility in Traditional SEO: Ranking Position\n\nIn the SEO era, visibility was easy to define. A website’s visibility was determined by its ranking position:\n\nRank #1 was the most visible, rank #10 somewhat visible, and rank #11 effectively invisible.\n\nThis model had clear advantages—it was intuitive, easy to quantify, and simple to compare.\n\nHowever, it relied on a core assumption: that users would click through search results one by one. In reality, even a #1 ranking has no value if no one clicks, while a #10 ranking can still be successful if it attracts significant user attention. Despite this complexity, SEO traditionally simplified visibility into a single metric: ranking.\n\n---\n\n## Visibility in GEO: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation\n\nGenerative engines break this simplistic model.\n\n![Visibility in GEO: A Multi-Dimensional Evaluation](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/geo-vs-seo/8a0c3487ef9fd7d9836eb60830ea102a.png)\n\n\nIn AI-generated answers, **there is no concept of ranking**. A single response may cite five different sources simultaneously. All of them are “visible,” but to varying degrees.\n\nResearch from Princeton University and the Indian Institutes of Technology proposes three key visibility metrics to more comprehensively evaluate how content performs within generative engines:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Word Count Impact\n\nThis is the most basic metric:\n\nHow much of the AI-generated answer is derived from your content?\n\nFor example, if an AI response is 500 words long and 100 words are sourced from your content, your word count impact is 20%.\n\nThis metric reflects a simple reality: the more content that is cited, the more information users actually see from you. A single quoted sentence has limited impact, whereas an entire paragraph significantly increases user exposure and perceived value.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Position-Weighted Word Count\n\nThis metric accounts for a well-established psychological principle: **user attention decreases from top to bottom**.\n\nContent that appears at the beginning of an AI-generated answer is far more likely to be noticed than content buried at the end. The position-weighted word count assigns higher weights to citations appearing earlier in the response and lower weights to those appearing later.\n\nAs a result, a 200-word citation at the top of an answer is substantially more valuable than a 200-word citation at the bottom.\n\nThis metric is critical because it reflects real user behavior. Even if your content is cited extensively, it may have little practical impact if it consistently appears at the end of the response—where users may never reach it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Subjective Display Impact\n\nThis is the most complex, yet most meaningful metric. It evaluates the quality and influence of a citation across seven dimensions:\n\n* **Relevance**: How closely the cited content matches the user query\n* **Impact**: Whether the citation contributes a core insight or merely a supporting detail\n* **Uniqueness**: Whether the information is exclusive to this source or widely duplicated\n* **Authority**: Whether the cited source is perceived as credible and trustworthy\n* **Completeness**: Whether the information is presented fully or partially truncated\n* **Contextual Appropriateness**: Whether the citation is placed within a suitable explanatory context\n* **Brand Presence**: Whether the brand name is clearly associated with the cited content\n\nThis metric captures a crucial truth: **not all citations are equal**.\nA citation from an authoritative source, highly relevant to the query, positioned prominently, clearly attributed, and explicitly branded is vastly more valuable than a vague, unattributed reference embedded deep within the response.\n\n---\n\n## From Metrics to Strategy\n\nThe existence of these three metrics directly points to the strategic direction of GEO.\n\nIt is no longer sufficient to be cited. Content must:\n\n* Occupy a larger proportion of the generated answer (**Word Count Impact**)\n* Appear in highly visible positions (**Position-Weighted Word Count**)\n* Be presented in a way that maximizes influence and attribution (**Subjective Display Impact**)\n\nThis also explains why only **around 30% of brands remain visible across two consecutive AI-generated answers**. Visibility in generative engines is inherently multi-dimensional, and changes in any single dimension can significantly affect overall visibility.\n\n---\n\n\n## Core Principles of GEO: Three New Visibility Signals\n\nNow that we understand how GEO measures visibility, we can examine the factors that determine performance across these metrics.\n\n---\n\n## Signal 1: Freshness Is the Foundation of Trust\n\nIn the era of AI search, content freshness has become a core trust signal—not merely for ranking algorithms, but for the LLMs themselves, which must ensure informational accuracy.\n\nWhen AI models generate answers—especially for commercial or comparative queries—they prioritize fresh and up-to-date content. Outdated information can easily lead to incorrect recommendations. For example, if a SaaS tool has changed its pricing or discontinued a feature, but an AI model cites content from three months ago, the user receives an inaccurate answer. At scale, this is fatal to the credibility of an AI system.\n\nThe data makes this clear:\n\n* Pages without quarterly updates are **three times less likely** to be cited by AI than recently updated pages\n* Over **70% of AI-cited pages** have been updated within the past 12 months\n* For commercial queries, freshness requirements are even stricter—**83% of commercial citations** come from pages updated within the last year\n* In fast-moving industries such as SaaS, finance, and news, the effective content update window may shrink to **three months or less**\n\nThis means content maintenance is no longer an optional optimization—it is a baseline requirement for GEO. Brands must establish disciplined content update workflows and treat maintenance as a continuous, non-negotiable process.\n\n---\n\n## Signal 2: Structured Content Is the Language of LLMs\n\nAI models do not interpret ambiguous or loosely structured content the way humans do. They rely on clear structural signals to quickly and accurately understand a page. Structured content provides these signals, making information easier for LLMs to parse, extract, and cite.\n\n### The Power of Heading Hierarchy\n\nClear, sequential heading structures (a single H1 followed by H2 and H3) are critical. Research shows that orderly heading hierarchies are associated with **2.8× higher citation likelihood**.\n\nWhen a page follows a clean H1–H2–H3 structure, models can rapidly identify the topic, key sections, and information hierarchy. By contrast, pages with multiple H1s or skipped levels (e.g., jumping from H1 directly to H3) require more computational effort to interpret, reducing citation probability.\n\n---\n\n### Schema Markup as a Relevance Signal\n\nRich schema markup—particularly **FAQ and Q&amp;A schema**—provides strong relevance signals to both search engines and LLMs. Pages using FAQ schema are **40% more likely** to be cited by AI.\n\nWhen FAQ schema is present, models can directly map structured answers to user queries. Pages that implement **three or more schema types** show a further **13% increase** in citation likelihood.\n\n---\n\n### Lists and Readability\n\nBreaking dense text into lists and scannable blocks improves both human readability and LLM extraction efficiency. Data shows that nearly [**80% of ChatGPT-cited pages**](https://nectivdigital.com/new-data-study-chatgpt-citations-are-2-3x-more-likely-to-include-a-table-than-google-search/) use list-based structures, compared to only **29%** among Google’s traditional top-ranking results.\n\n---\n\n## Signal 3: Off-Site Credibility Builds the Trust Layer\n\nThis is perhaps the most counterintuitive—and most important—finding in GEO:\nthe authority of a brand’s own website is becoming less important in AI search. In its place, **communities and user-generated content (UGC)** are emerging as a stronger trust layer.\n\n---\n\n### The Overwhelming Advantage of Third-Party Sources\n\nAirOps analyzed data from over **21,000 brands** and uncovered a striking result:\n**85% of brand mentions** in AI-generated answers come from third-party sources rather than brand-owned websites.\n\nEven more telling, brands are **6.5× more likely** to be cited through third-party content than through their own domains.\n\nIn practical terms, this means a perfectly crafted article on your website—produced over months—may be less valuable than a 10-minute Reddit comment written by a real user. Domain authority is no longer the deciding factor. What matters is **how the broader web talks about you**.\n\nNearly **90% of third-party brand mentions** come from lists, comparison pages, and review roundups. AI models recognize that when multiple independent sites list a product as “one of the best,” it represents a powerful consensus signal.\n\n---\n\n### The Power of Community Discussions\n\nApproximately [**48% of AI search citations**](https://surferseo.com/blog/ai-citation-report/) originate from community platforms such as Reddit and YouTube. This is not because these platforms host the most authoritative content, but because they represent **authentic, unfiltered user discussions and feedback**.\n\nReddit alone appears as a cited source in roughly **22% of generated answers**.\n\nAI models have learned a simple truth: when real users openly discuss and recommend a product, it is far more credible than a brand claiming, “We’re great,” on its own website.\n\n![The Power of Community Discussions](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/geo-vs-seo/e6818107dcabe3c75a6d70295baf166a.png)\n\n\n## Why Traditional SEO Strategies Fail in Generative Engines\n\nHaving understood the three core GEO signals, we can now clearly see why many traditional SEO strategies not only fail in generative engines, but can actually be harmful.\n\n---\n\n### The End of Keyword Stuffing\n\nKeyword stuffing was once a central SEO tactic. By repeatedly inserting target keywords into content, site owners could signal to search engines that “this page is highly relevant to this query.” In an era of relatively simple algorithms, this approach was often effective.\n\nIn generative engines, however, the situation is fundamentally different.\n\nExperimental data from GEO research shows that keyword stuffing has **little to no positive effect** in generative search—and in many cases, it **reduces visibility**. This is not because language models fail to understand keywords, but because they understand them **too well**.\n\nLLMs interpret content through semantics and context rather than keyword matching. When excessive keywords are inserted, models recognize the hallmarks of low-quality content: unnatural language patterns, repetition, and forced phrasing. These signals are strongly associated with cheap optimization tactics and directly lower a model’s assessment of content quality and citation likelihood.\n\nAI models are explicitly trained to detect and filter spam, and keyword stuffing is one of the most obvious indicators of spam-like content.\n\n---\n\n### The Relative Decline of Domain Authority\n\nThis shift is even more profound, as it signals a fundamental reordering of the search ecosystem itself.\n\nIn the SEO era, domain authority was the foundation of everything. Once established, it was difficult to displace. Large websites benefited from high authority, allowing them to rank well even with mediocre content, while smaller sites—despite producing higher-quality material—struggled to compete. This created a classic “winner-takes-all” environment.\n\nIn AI-driven search, this dynamic is being reversed.\n\nBrands are **6.5× more likely** to be cited through third-party sources than through their own websites, directly challenging the centrality of domain authority. Authority is no longer determined by the strength of your domain alone, but by **how the broader web discusses and references your brand**.\n\nThis transition has far-reaching implications for every participant in the search ecosystem.\n\n\n### The Democratizing Effect of GEO: Lower-Ranked Sites Benefit the Most\n\nIf the decline of domain authority is bad news for large websites, then GEO is exceptionally good news for smaller ones—representing a shift unlike anything seen before.\n\nGEO research compared the impact of GEO optimization across sites at different ranking positions:\n\n* Sites ranked #5 experienced a **115% increase in visibility** after applying GEO strategies\n* Sites ranked #1, using the same methods, saw visibility **decline by up to 30%**\n\nTraditional SEO, driven by backlink volume and domain authority, tends to reinforce already dominant players. GEO, by contrast, prioritizes content quality, freshness, structural clarity, and community validation—creating a genuine opportunity for small and mid-sized websites to catch up.\n\nSmaller competitors no longer need to outspend large brands on link-building campaigns. They simply need to create **better content**.\nThis is true democratization.\n\n---\n\n## Reallocating Resources: The Shift from SEO to GEO + SEO\n\nWith a clear understanding of how GEO works, a practical question emerges: how should limited resources be allocated? This is not a binary choice between SEO and GEO, but a matter of **reprioritization**.\n\n---\n\n### Resource Allocation: Then and Now\n\n**The Old SEO Model:**\n\n* 80% link building and domain authority growth\n* 15% technical optimization\n* 5% content quality\n\nThis allocation reflects a belief that rankings are primarily driven by link authority, justifying the concentration of resources in that area.\n\n---\n\n**The New GEO + SEO Model:**\n\n* 40% content freshness and quality (serving both SEO and GEO)\n* 25% structured content and interpretability (serving both SEO and GEO)\n* 15% third-party engagement and community building (primarily for GEO)\n* 15% technical optimization and link building (primarily for SEO)\n* 5% AI visibility monitoring (a new GEO-specific function)\n\n---\n\n### The Logic Behind the Reallocation\n\nFirst, content freshness and structured presentation are critical to both SEO and GEO, making them the highest priorities. Freshness supports SEO by signaling active site maintenance, and GEO by ensuring informational accuracy. Structured content benefits SEO by improving crawlability, and GEO by enabling LLMs to quickly parse and extract key information.\n\nSecond, third-party engagement primarily supports GEO, as it directly influences the likelihood of brand citations—by a factor of **6.5×**.\n\nFinally, technical optimization and link building remain important, but their relative priority declines. This is not because they no longer matter, but because within the GEO framework their impact is diminished. Even sites with imperfect technical foundations can still earn AI citations if their content is sufficiently high-quality, up-to-date, and actively discussed across the web.\n\n## **Conclusion: The Beginning of a New Era**\n\nA paradigm shift in search has already happened.\nThis is not a distant future scenario—it is a reality unfolding right now in 2025–2026.\n\nThe way users access information is undergoing a fundamental transformation.\nThey are no longer simply clicking through search result pages; instead, they are increasingly **reading answers generated directly by AI**. Search is evolving from *link distribution* to *answer generation*.\n\nIn this context, **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is fundamentally about **rebuilding the connection between brands and users in the age of generative engines**.\nTraditional SEO connects users to ranked lists of websites.\nGEO connects users directly to information itself.\n\nAs generative engines become the primary gateway for information discovery, the latter clearly aligns more closely with real user behavior.\nFor brands targeting global markets, GEO represents a rare opportunity to **overtake competitors on the curve**.\n\nWhile most players are still locked into traditional SEO content production models, brands that adopt GEO strategies early are already gaining **disproportionate visibility and mindshare** within generative engines.\nThis is not merely a technical evolution—it is a cognitive upgrade.\n\nThe future is already here; it is just unevenly distributed.\nNow is the time to act.\n\n---\n\nAs a data provider, the motivation behind developing **LLM Chat Scraper** came from a deceptively simple question we were repeatedly asked:\n\n**“How can we capture the real responses users receive when interacting with large models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity?”**\n\nOfficial APIs cannot fully replicate real user conversations, while manual testing—though intuitive—cannot be scaled or systematized for serious research.\n\nTo address this gap, we built **LLM Chat Scraper**, a tool designed to analyze **AI visibility**.\nIt captures complete front-end responses from generative engines—**including full answers and citations**—**without requiring login and without exposing conversation context**.\n\nThis enables teams to truly understand **how their brands and content are presented and cited within generative engines**.\n\nCurrently, **LLM Chat Scraper** supports front-end data collection and analysis from the following LLM chat platforms:\n\n* ChatGPT\n* Perplexity\n* Microsoft Copilot\n* Google Gemini\n* Google AI Mode\n* Grok\n\nWe charge only for successfully scraped results, with pricing as low as **$1 per 1,000 records—approximately one-tenth the cost of official APIs**.\nIf you’re interested, feel free to [contact us ](https://t.me/liam_scrapeless)to request a **free trial**.",

Forrester analysts note that the market for AEO is already *flush with venture capital and buzz*, as companies race to provide tools for this emerging need[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=Now%20the%20tables%20have%20turned,capital%20and%20brimming%20with%20buzzwords).\n\nAt its core, AEO is similar to SEO in demanding high-quality, authoritative content and technical optimizations (like schema markup) to help AI engines find and trust your content[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=AEO%20Demands%20New%20Content%2C%20Technical%2C,And%20Measurement%20Best%20Practices)[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=2,indexable%20by%20answer%20engines%E2%80%99%20crawlers). However, succeeding in AEO also requires new practices: understanding the **questions** users ask AI, how AI bots crawl and cite content, and how to measure “AI visibility” without traditional click-through metrics[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=1,more%20visible%20in%20answer%20engines)[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=3,authority%20without%20ranked%20blue%20links). In response, a new class of **AEO tools** has appeared. These platforms automate the tedious work of feeding prompts into AI services, scraping the responses, and analyzing where and how your brand is mentioned. In theory, they help marketers track their share of voice in AI answers and identify opportunities to improve it[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=AI%20visibility%20tools%20%28a,cite%20your%20content%20more%20often).\n\nYet **chasing prompt tracking alone is a recipe for failure.** It’s not enough to monitor how often your brand appears in AI outputs: you must act on the insights by creating better content. Just as having an SEO tool doesn’t magically increase organic traffic, simply using an AEO tracker won’t boost AI citations of your brand without follow-through[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=But%20that%E2%80%99s%20all%20just%20good,we%20have%20a%20Profound%20account). In fact, many AEO platforms today are essentially “synthetic query runners” they repeatedly ask sample questions and log whether you’re mentioned[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=means%20something%27s%20broken). This data is useful, but it won’t improve on its own. Moreover, large language models often *infer* answers from their training data and retrieval techniques; the actual prompts and responses they generate can vary, and not every user’s query is observable[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=1,gauge%20consistency%20and%20spot%20trends)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=,users%20see%20in%20their%20prompt). In short, focusing solely on tracking metrics (prompt mention rates, AI visibility scores, etc.) without improving your content is a dead end. The **key to AEO success is creating content that AI** ***wants*** **to cite**[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Takeaway%3A%20Classic%20SEO%20metrics%20don%E2%80%99t,clear%2C%20factual%2C%20and%20relevant%20answers), clear, factual, and comprehensive answers to the questions your audience is asking.\n\nThis report provides a detailed comparison of four leading AEO vendors in 2025, **Peec**, **Profound**, **AirOps**, and [**Outwrite.ai**](http://outwrite.ai), with an emphasis on how each addresses (or doesn’t address) that critical gap between insight and action. Each vendor is evaluated on its capabilities, strengths, and ideal use cases. Our goal is to educate enterprise demand-gen teams, marketers, and even solo founders on the AEO landscape and why an end-to-end approach (not just prompt tracking) is crucial for success.\n\n# [**Peec.ai**](http://Peec.ai) – Visibility Tracking on a Budget\n\n[Peec.ai](http://Peec.ai) is an AEO tool focused on **brand visibility tracking** and competitor insights within AI search results[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms). Founded by SEO veteran Malte Landwehr, Peec takes a straightforward approach: it simulates real users querying various LLM-based search engines via proxies, and then extracts your **brand mentions and citations** from the AI-generated answers[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Malte%20from%20Peec%20AI%20here). The platform then calculates metrics like visibility share and sentiment for each brand mentioned[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Malte%20from%20Peec%20AI%20here). In essence, Peec gives you a real-time pulse on how your brand (and competitors) are appearing in answers from systems like ChatGPT, Google’s AI Search, Perplexity, etc., and whether those mentions are positive or negative.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Affordability and Unlimited Scope:** Peec is known as one of the more affordable AEO trackers, with plans reportedly starting around €89/month[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=AEO%20Score%3A%2049%2F100). Unlike many competitors, even its lower-tier plans support **unlimited user seats and country tracking**, making it cost-effective for teams monitoring multiple markets[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=). This pricing model lowers the barrier for small companies to start AEO tracking.  \n* **Competitor Benchmarking:** Peec enables side-by-side **competitor visibility comparisons**. It automatically labels and groups citations by domain and content type, aiming to show which competitor content pieces are getting cited by AI[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=Peec%20tries%20to%20help%20you,in%20the%20most%20helpful%20way). This helps marketers identify content gaps: for example, if rivals’ blog articles or listicles are being cited for a query and yours aren’t, you’ve spotted an opportunity. Peec also tracks sentiment of mentions (are AI references to your brand positive, neutral, or negative), which is valuable for PR and brand reputation monitoring[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms).  \n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* **Shallow Automation, Few Integrations:** Peec’s strength is tracking, but it offers little beyond data. It lacks deeper content analytics or integration with web analytics/log data. Analysts note that Peec provides limited “backend” analysis – there’s no log-file AI crawler data or GA4 integration as you’d find in enterprise tools[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,Limited%20backend%20or%20log%20analysis). Essentially, you get the **surface metrics** (who’s mentioned where), but not much insight into *why* or how to directly act on it.  \n* **Clunky Data Labeling:** While Peec tries to auto-label citation sources (identifying a result as a “blog post”, “listicle”, “docs site”, etc.), its taxonomy is one-dimensional and often incomplete[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=Peec%20tries%20to%20help%20you,in%20the%20most%20helpful%20way). A single piece of content often fits multiple categories (an article that is both a listicle and a comparison), but Peec will tag it as only one, leading to incomplete data labeling[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=URL%20and%20domain%20typologies%20are,that%20in%20an%20exported%20spreadsheet). There’s no way to fix these labels in-app, so meaningful analysis may require exporting data and manually cleaning it[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=means%20your%20data%20is%20almost,that%20in%20an%20exported%20spreadsheet). This can be time-consuming, undercutting the “automation” promise.  \n* **No Content Creation Features:** Importantly, Peec does **not help create or optimize content** – it’s purely a tracking tool. Users must take the insights and go elsewhere to produce content. This means Peec addresses the “monitoring” side of AEO but leaves the “optimization” entirely up to you.  \n\n**Ideal Use Case:** Peec is a solid entry-level AEO tracker for **budget-conscious teams** that want to dip their toes in AI visibility monitoring[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=AEO%20Score%3A%2049%2F100). A small business or agency can use Peec to prove the concept of AI search tracking – show a client how often they vs. competitors appear in AI answers – without a big investment. However, larger enterprises with advanced needs (multi-language data, compliance, or integration into content workflows) may outgrow Peec quickly. It’s a useful alert system to **understand brand presence**, but you’ll need additional strategy and tools to act on the data and improve that presence.\n\n# Profound (TryProfound) – Enterprise-Grade AI Visibility Platform\n\nProfound is widely regarded as the **enterprise leader** in AEO platforms. In independent rankings it often comes out on top – Overthink Group’s hands-on evaluation ranked Profound #1 for AI visibility tools[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=The%20Best%20AI%20Visibility%20Tools,sentiment%20analysis%2C%20decent%20parameter%20definition), and a recent analysis gave it the highest “AEO Score” (92/100) of any platform in 2025[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Top%20AI%20Visibility%20Platforms%20by,AEO%20Score). Profound positions itself as a **comprehensive AI visibility and optimization suite** built for large organizations. It combines multiple data sources and capabilities: prompt result tracking, AI crawler log analysis, content performance analytics, and even compliance features[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=G2%20Winter%202026%20AEO%20Leader%3A,Answer%20Engine%20Optimization%29%20category).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Deep Data and Insights:** Profound offers richer data than perhaps any competitor. It doesn’t rely only on front-end prompt scraping; it also uses **server-side and log-level data**. For example, Profound ingest logs of AI crawlers hitting your site to show what content LLMs have indexed[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control). It has a *Conversation Explorer* that reveals actual user questions being asked on AI platforms (like a keyword research tool for ChatGPT queries)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=When%20we%20first%20started%20looking,with%20AI%20chatbots%20like%20ChatGPT). And it tracks citations across at least **10 major AI engines** – from GPT-4/5 and Google’s various AI modes to Perplexity, Claude, Meta AI, and more. The platform correlates this data into an **AEO Score** that factors citation frequency, prominence, domain authority, content freshness, structured data usage, etc., giving enterprises a singular KPI for AI visibility. In short, Profound provides a *360° view* of how AI sees and uses your content.  \n* **Enterprise Features (Security, Scale, Integrations):** As an enterprise tool, Profound checks all the boxes for security and scale. It’s SOC 2 Type II certified and even HIPAA compliant, allowing use in regulated industries like healthcare[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=HIPAA%20Compliance%3A%20Profound%20achieved%20HIPAA,AEO%20while%20maintaining%20regulatory%20compliance). It supports multilingual tracking and analysis (30+ languages) for global companies[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=GCP%20Integration%3A%20Agent%20Analytics%20now,hosted%20content). Integrations are a strong point: Profound can pipe data into Google Analytics (GA4) to attribute AI-sourced traffic[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control), and it offers plugins for CMS like WordPress to monitor AI crawler behavior on your site[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Optimization%29%20category). These features make it easier for large teams to incorporate AEO data into their existing marketing tech stack.  \n* **Continuous Innovation:** Backed by substantial funding (a $35M Series B led by Sequoia Capital[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Prompt%20Volumes%20Dataset%3A%20Built%20on,people%20are%20asking%20AI%20systems)), Profound is rapidly adding features. Recent updates in late 2025 include tracking of the latest models (OpenAI GPT-5.2) across the suite[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Recent%20Platform%20Enhancements%3A), new **Profound Workflows** to automate content audits and optimizations for AI search[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=responses%20in%20dashboards%20now%20reflect,OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20most%20advanced%20frontier%20model), and even a **“Profound Index” leaderboard that ranks brands by how often they appear in AI answers**[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=retailers%20visibility%20into%20conversational%20commerce). This pace of innovation solidifies its position as a category leader and signals that it keeps pace with the fast-moving AI landscape.  \n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Cost and Complexity:** Profound is built for large enterprises, and its pricing and complexity reflect that. While exact pricing isn’t public, it starts in the hundreds of dollars per month range (HogTheWeb notes pricing from $199/mo and up)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20Profound%E2%80%99s%20focus,It%E2%80%99s%20a%20bit%20like), and likely much higher for full enterprise licenses. The platform’s numerous features may be overkill for small teams – it’s a **heavyweight tool** that assumes you have the resources (and expertise) to leverage advanced analytics and integrations. Smaller businesses might find it too complex, both in implementation and in interpreting the deluge of data it provides.  \n* **Not an All-in-One Marketer’s Tool:** Profound excels at **diagnostics** – showing where you stand in AI search – but it doesn’t by itself create content or manage your content workflow. It will tell you, for example, that Competitor X’s listicle is cited more often than your equivalent page for a given prompt, or that your share of voice in “AI overviews” is low for a topic[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms). Acting on that insight (i.e., creating new content or revamping pages) is left to your team. In that sense, Profound is a specialized *analytics and tracking* platform. Enterprises will still need to pair it with a strong content marketing operation to see actual results. (Notably, Profound has introduced workflow features to audit and optimize content[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=responses%20in%20dashboards%20now%20reflect,OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20most%20advanced%20frontier%20model), but it’s more assistive than generative – it streamlines human work, rather than writing content for you.)  \n\n**Ideal Use Case:** Profound is the **best fit for large enterprises and data-driven marketing teams** that demand precision and depth. If you are in a **regulated or security-conscious industry** (finance, healthcare, etc.) or need to monitor AI visibility across many international markets, Profound is built for you[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Series%20B%20from%20Sequoia%20Capital,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=GCP%20Integration%3A%20Agent%20Analytics%20now,hosted%20content). These organizations typically have the budget and in-house experts to take advantage of Profound’s advanced features. It helps them uncover granular insights – e.g. exactly which content pieces to update, how AI crawlers are behaving, and whether changes lead to improved citations. For a lean startup or solo marketer, however, Profound would likely be overwhelming and costly. They might instead opt for lighter solutions or all-in-one tools that include content creation.\n\n# AirOps – Workflow Automation from Insight to Content\n\nAirOps is a unique player in this space, positioning itself not just as an AI visibility tracker but as an **AI-powered content operations platform**. It’s designed for marketing teams that want to integrate AEO insights directly into their content creation and optimization processes. In other words, AirOps goes a step further than pure tracking: it helps you **take action** on the data at scale[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=AirOps%20helps%20teams%20win%20AI,search)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Take%20precise%20action). The platform combines features of an AEO tracker (monitoring where you show up in AI search) with an automation toolkit to produce and update content (often termed “content engineering”).\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n\n* **Integrated AEO + SEO Workflows:** AirOps allows users to build multi-step **workflows** that tie together research, content generation, and optimization tasks. A simple example: identify questions where a competitor is cited but you are not (visibility insight) → fetch that competitor’s content → use an LLM to analyze gaps → generate an improved piece of content or brief. These workflows are constructed in a visual interface (drag-and-drop), connecting steps like a Google Search query, a web scraper, and an LLM prompt into a sequence[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=AirOps%20has%20two%20core%20components)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Grids%20). Once a workflow (the “recipe”) is set up, AirOps lets you run it at scale across many inputs via **Grids**, analogous to applying a function across rows in a spreadsheet[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Grids%20)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Build%20the%20recipe,Workflow). This system turns what used to be one-off prompt fiddling into a **repeatable, scalable process**. As one reviewer put it, *“Prompts save minutes. Workflows save hours. Grids save whole weeks.”*[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=AirOps%20turns%20SEO%2FAEO%20into%20something,Article%20%E2%86%92%20Optimization%E2%80%A6%20all%20automated)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Workflows%20beat%20prompts,Grids%20save%20whole%20weeks) – underscoring that AirOps helps teams move beyond ad-hoc prompting to systematic content production.  \n* **From Insight to Action:** AirOps is often praised for closing the loop between seeing a visibility gap and filling it. It provides **visibility insights** similar to other AEO tools – e.g. showing which questions your audience is asking, where your brand or others are mentioned, and your content’s citation rank[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=See%20where%20you%20stand). But critically, it then *tells you what to do* and enables you to do it. The platform can surface a list of “opportunities” – for instance, topics or specific queries where competitors are winning – each coupled with a suggested action like *“refresh your existing article on X with Y info”*[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Surface%20your%20highest%20leverage%20opportunities). Users can then execute that action inside AirOps: update content or generate new content with the help of AI models, and publish it (it supports CMS integrations and direct publishing)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Take%20precise%20action). By monitoring results over time, AirOps creates a feedback loop so you can watch your AI visibility score improve as you implement its recommendations[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Once%20you%20know%20what%20to,your%20brand%20visibility%20score%20rise). This **insight-to-execution pipeline** is AirOps’ hallmark, designed to *drive pipeline and results, not just produce reports*[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Visibility%20insights%20are%20just%20the,Only%20action%20drives%20pipeline)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=AirOps%20helps%20teams%20win%20AI,search).  \n* **Training and “Content Engineering” Focus:** A distinguishing aspect of AirOps is its emphasis on upskilling marketers to become “Content Engineers.” The company provides an educational platform (AirOps University) to teach users how to design effective AI-driven content systems[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=The%20best%20teams%20win%20by,adapting%20content%20strategies%20at%20scale)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=You%20might%20assume%20reviews%20are,me%20something%20more%20valuable%3A%20skills). The idea of *content engineering* is treating content creation like building a machine – designing repeatable systems that can produce high-quality content at scale, rather than writing each piece manually[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=So,Content%20Engineer)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=You%20go%20from%20chef%20%E2%86%92,kitchen%20designer). For teams willing to invest time in this approach, AirOps can be transformative. It effectively turns content marketing into a more technical, automated operation (the analogy used: moving from being the chef to designing the kitchen)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=engineers,Let%E2%80%99s%20start%20with%20a%20story)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=It%20turns%20insights%20into%20action,Without%20drama). This is especially powerful for agencies or large content teams who need to output a lot of AI-optimized content efficiently, while maintaining consistency and quality.  \n\n**Target Audience:** AirOps is best suited for **marketing teams and agencies** that have significant content production needs and are ready to embrace automation. It’s a platform for those who want to *not only see where they stand* in AI search, but systematically **do something about it** across their whole site or client portfolio. Enterprises that want to unify traditional SEO and AEO efforts may find AirOps appealing – it explicitly aims to bridge SEO and AI visibility in one system[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/organic-search-marketing#:~:text=AirOps%20www,optimization%2C%20and%20scalable%20content%20workflows)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/insights#:~:text=AirOps%20Insights%20,Support). On the other hand, solo founders or very small teams might find AirOps’ robust platform a bit overwhelming or beyond their immediate needs. It often requires a shift in mindset (learning workflows, etc.) and possibly a higher budget (pricing is custom or via demo, indicating a focus on larger accounts). For those smaller players, a more out-of-the-box solution could be preferable – which is where our next vendor, [Outwrite.ai](http://Outwrite.ai), comes in.\n\n# [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) – End-to-End AEO for Content Creation (Top Pick for SMBs)\n\n[**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **stands out as an all-in-one AEO solution** that is particularly well-suited for solo founders, small businesses, and lean marketing teams. Unlike other platforms that emphasize only tracking or only point solutions, Outwrite was built with the philosophy that *“creating the content is more important than just tracking prompts.”* It combines **prompt-based AI visibility tracking, competitive research, AI content generation, and even one-click publishing** into a single affordable package[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Research%20%E2%86%92%20Create%20%E2%86%92%20Publish,%E2%86%92%20Get%20Cited%20%E2%86%92%20Track)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Publish%20%26%20Get%20Cited). This end-to-end approach addresses the core problem we discussed earlier: the need to close the gap between insight and action. With Outwrite, users can go from identifying a visibility gap to having new content published to fill that gap in literally minutes, not weeks[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=How%20It%20Works)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=AI%20Creates%20Better%20Content).\n\n**Key Features and Advantages:**\n\n* **“Research → Create → Publish → Track” Workflow:** Outwrite guides users through a four-step process within one platform[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Research%20%E2%86%92%20Create%20%E2%86%92%20Publish,%E2%86%92%20Get%20Cited%20%E2%86%92%20Track). First, you **Discover Citation Opportunities** by either scanning your website or entering a topic; Outwrite will show which questions in AI search your content (or your competitors’ content) is being cited for, and what content is winning those citations[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Discover%20Citation%20Opportunities). Next, **AI Creates Better Content** – Outwrite’s AI uses the insights to generate a superior, citation-optimized article or post in under 60 seconds[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=AI%20Creates%20Better%20Content). You can then **Publish** the content with one click (direct integrations to WordPress, Shopify, and even auto-formatted outputs for channels like Reddit or LinkedIn are provided)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Publish%20%26%20Get%20Cited). Finally, Outwrite **Tracks Your AI Visibility** over time, monitoring how the new content gains citations on platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=One,AI%20systems%20cite%20your%20expertise). This closed-loop system means even a one-person team can continuously improve AI visibility without juggling multiple tools.  \n* **Content Optimized for AI (and SEO):** Outwrite is keenly focused on generating content that *AI models want to cite*. It analyzes what currently gets cited and then produces content with those patterns – for instance, including concise Q&amp;A sections, factual snippets, schema markup, and other **LLM-friendly structures**[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Optimized%20for%20AI%20Citations)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Q%26A%20sections%2C%20answer%20fragments%2C%20and,for%20AI%20retrieval%20and%20citation). The platform boasts “perfect schema every time” (automatically added structured data), which is critical since well-structured content is easier for AI to parse and trust[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over). At the same time, Outwrite adheres to Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines and claims the AI-written pieces will also perform in traditional search without penalty[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Win%20Both%20Google%20Search%20AND,AI%20Citations). This dual optimization for SEO and AEO can save small teams from having to rewrite AI content for Google – a significant benefit as it avoids trade-offs between ranking on Google and getting cited by ChatGPT.  \n* **Affordable Pricing for SMBs:** Outwrite has a transparent, self-serve pricing model that is much lower than typical enterprise tools. For example, the **Essentials plan is $97/month** and includes 15 AI-written articles/posts per month plus tracking of 10 prompts and basic visibility analytics[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Essentials)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Models%20run%205%2C000%20times%2Fmonth). Even the “Starter” tier at $197/mo allows up to 40 articles and more tracked prompts[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Starter)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Models%20run%2012%2C500%20times%2Fmonth). This pricing is within reach of solo entrepreneurs and small businesses, especially considering it could replace several separate services (content writers, SEO tools, and AEO trackers all in one). By lowering cost and complexity, Outwrite positions itself as *“the first to track, research, create, and publish”* in one tool – as one commenter quipped, “Game over.”[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over). For SMB users who can’t afford enterprise platforms or large content teams, this all-in-one value proposition is extremely compelling.  \n* **Results and Use Cases:** Early indicators show Outwrite’s approach can yield significant gains in AI visibility. Outwrite reports that average users have seen **1500%+ increases in clicks from ChatGPT** in \\~60 days of use[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Wordpress%20and%20Shopify%20integrations%2C%20Reddit,Game%20over). While that figure likely varies, it underscores the advantage of acting quickly on opportunities – something Outwrite enables. Additionally, Outwrite can host a blog for customers who don’t even have one (via a simple code embed)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Create%20content%20AI%20models%20want,to%20cite)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Blog%20Hosting%20Included), removing another barrier for a solo founder to start publishing AI-optimized content. Case studies (like “Danish Lead Co.” on their site) claim first client wins from AI search within weeks of using Outwrite[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Danish%20Lead%20Co). All this supports the idea that the **speed and integration** Outwrite offers can translate to real business outcomes fast.  \n\n**Why** [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **is the Top Choice for Small Teams:** The neutral analysis above highlights that many AEO tools stop at tracking, leaving users with data but no direct solution. [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **breaks that mold** by ensuring the creation of content is baked into the workflow. For solo founders and small marketing teams, this is a game-changer – it’s like having an SEO strategist, content writer, and AEO analyst all in one app. It addresses the core reason “prompt tracking alone” can fail: without new content, your visibility won’t improve. Outwrite essentially automates *the hard part – creating and publishing quality content targeted at the right gaps – at a fraction of the cost of hiring an agency or multiple specialists*. This makes AEO attainable for those who have more ambition than budget. While enterprises may still require the depth of a Profound or the custom workflows of AirOps, **for most small and mid-size businesses Outwrite offers the best balance of functionality, simplicity, and affordability** to actually *move the needle*. It’s an end-to-end growth tool in the AEO era, not just a report generator.\n\n# Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe AEO vendor landscape in 2025 is vibrant and evolving quickly, but also **skewed toward two extremes**. On one end, enterprise-focused platforms (like Profound, and to some extent AirOps) deliver exhaustive data and powerful automation, yet they assume you have a team and resources to leverage them. On the other end, several tools only tackle *visibility tracking* in isolation (Peec and others), which, while useful for awareness, don’t directly help you improve your standing. As our analysis shows, simply knowing your “AI visibility score” isn’t enough – you need to **increase** that visibility by creating content that AI will cite[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Takeaway%3A%20Classic%20SEO%20metrics%20don%E2%80%99t,clear%2C%20factual%2C%20and%20relevant%20answers). Chasing prompt metrics alone, without feeding the AI new high-quality answers about your brand, is indeed a dead-end strategy.\n\nFor enterprise marketing leaders, the takeaway is to be strategic: use these tools to identify content opportunities, but ensure you have a content engine ready to act on them. A combination of platforms might even be warranted (e.g. using Profound for deep analysis and AirOps or internal processes for content workflow automation). Remember that AEO success still boils down to fundamentals: understand your audience’s questions and deliver the best answers, formatted for AI consumption[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=1,more%20visible%20in%20answer%20engines)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20AI%20answers,Answer%20Engine%20Optimization). Tools can accelerate the research and monitoring, but human judgment is needed to prioritize and strategize effectively.\n\nFor **solo founders and small businesses**, the emergence of end-to-end solutions like [Outwrite.ai](http://Outwrite.ai) is promising. They level the playing field by automating sophisticated AEO tactics (from prompt mining to content publishing) that a tiny team could hardly do manually. If you’re a small player, focusing on a tool that helps you **create AI-optimized content** will likely yield more ROI than one that only audits your current (possibly sparse) content. In a sense, *content is the currency* in the AEO/AI search era – the brands that consistently produce useful, cite-worthy content will “train” the AI to recommend them. Invest accordingly.\n\nIn summary, AEO is rapidly becoming as essential as SEO for anyone concerned with digital visibility. The vendors discussed each address pieces of this puzzle: **Peec** for basic visibility tracking, **Profound** for enterprise-grade insight and control, **AirOps** for workflow automation and scaling, and [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) for a complete creation-to-tracking cycle. While each has merit, we emphasize that **the real win is in closing the loop** – using insights to drive content actions. Those who do so will turn AI search from a threat (stealing clicks) into an opportunity (new audience reach). As one industry expert succinctly put it, *“You don’t need to write faster – you need better ways to produce content”*[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Before%20we%20go%20deeper%2C%20here%E2%80%99s,the%20core%20lesson). The right AEO tools, used in the right way, will help you do exactly that, ensuring that when the machines answer questions, **your brand is the answer they recommend**.",

    "text": "AEO Vendor Comparison: Peec vs Profound vs AirOps vs Outwrite (2025 Analysis)\n**Introduction**\n\nAs generative AI transforms how people find information, **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** has emerged as the new counterpart to SEO. AEO focuses on improving a brand’s visibility in AI-driven search results (answers from ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat, Perplexity, and other LLM-based assistants)[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=AI%20visibility%20tools%20%28a,cite%20your%20content%20more%20often). Gartner predicts that by 2026, over one-third of web content will be created exclusively for AI and search engine consumption[gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/775391/1757027-integrate-aeo-and-seo-improve-online-search-and-answer-engine-visibility#:~:text=As%20AI,GEO%29%2C%20enabling). For marketers, this means rethinking content strategies to remain visible in “zero-click” AI answers and *generative* search summaries[gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/webinar/775391/1757027-integrate-aeo-and-seo-improve-online-search-and-answer-engine-visibility#:~:text=strategies%20to%20remain%20visible%20and,first). Forrester analysts note that the market for AEO is already *flush with venture capital and buzz*, as companies race to provide tools for this emerging need[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=Now%20the%20tables%20have%20turned,capital%20and%20brimming%20with%20buzzwords).\n\nAt its core, AEO is similar to SEO in demanding high-quality, authoritative content and technical optimizations (like schema markup) to help AI engines find and trust your content[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=AEO%20Demands%20New%20Content%2C%20Technical%2C,And%20Measurement%20Best%20Practices)[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=2,indexable%20by%20answer%20engines%E2%80%99%20crawlers). However, succeeding in AEO also requires new practices: understanding the **questions** users ask AI, how AI bots crawl and cite content, and how to measure “AI visibility” without traditional click-through metrics[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=1,more%20visible%20in%20answer%20engines)[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=3,authority%20without%20ranked%20blue%20links). In response, a new class of **AEO tools** has appeared. These platforms automate the tedious work of feeding prompts into AI services, scraping the responses, and analyzing where and how your brand is mentioned. In theory, they help marketers track their share of voice in AI answers and identify opportunities to improve it[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=AI%20visibility%20tools%20%28a,cite%20your%20content%20more%20often).\n\nYet **chasing prompt tracking alone is a recipe for failure.** It’s not enough to monitor how often your brand appears in AI outputs: you must act on the insights by creating better content. Just as having an SEO tool doesn’t magically increase organic traffic, simply using an AEO tracker won’t boost AI citations of your brand without follow-through[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=But%20that%E2%80%99s%20all%20just%20good,we%20have%20a%20Profound%20account). In fact, many AEO platforms today are essentially “synthetic query runners” they repeatedly ask sample questions and log whether you’re mentioned[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=means%20something%27s%20broken). This data is useful, but it won’t improve on its own. Moreover, large language models often *infer* answers from their training data and retrieval techniques; the actual prompts and responses they generate can vary, and not every user’s query is observable[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=1,gauge%20consistency%20and%20spot%20trends)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=,users%20see%20in%20their%20prompt). In short, focusing solely on tracking metrics (prompt mention rates, AI visibility scores, etc.) without improving your content is a dead end. The **key to AEO success is creating content that AI** ***wants*** **to cite**[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Takeaway%3A%20Classic%20SEO%20metrics%20don%E2%80%99t,clear%2C%20factual%2C%20and%20relevant%20answers), clear, factual, and comprehensive answers to the questions your audience is asking.\n\nThis report provides a detailed comparison of four leading AEO vendors in 2025, **Peec**, **Profound**, **AirOps**, and [**Outwrite.ai**](http://outwrite.ai), with an emphasis on how each addresses (or doesn’t address) that critical gap between insight and action. Each vendor is evaluated on its capabilities, strengths, and ideal use cases. Our goal is to educate enterprise demand-gen teams, marketers, and even solo founders on the AEO landscape and why an end-to-end approach (not just prompt tracking) is crucial for success.\n\n# [**Peec.ai**](http://Peec.ai) – Visibility Tracking on a Budget\n\n[Peec.ai](http://Peec.ai) is an AEO tool focused on **brand visibility tracking** and competitor insights within AI search results[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms). Founded by SEO veteran Malte Landwehr, Peec takes a straightforward approach: it simulates real users querying various LLM-based search engines via proxies, and then extracts your **brand mentions and citations** from the AI-generated answers[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Malte%20from%20Peec%20AI%20here). The platform then calculates metrics like visibility share and sentiment for each brand mentioned[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Malte%20from%20Peec%20AI%20here). In essence, Peec gives you a real-time pulse on how your brand (and competitors) are appearing in answers from systems like ChatGPT, Google’s AI Search, Perplexity, etc., and whether those mentions are positive or negative.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Affordability and Unlimited Scope:** Peec is known as one of the more affordable AEO trackers, with plans reportedly starting around €89/month[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=AEO%20Score%3A%2049%2F100). Unlike many competitors, even its lower-tier plans support **unlimited user seats and country tracking**, making it cost-effective for teams monitoring multiple markets[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=). This pricing model lowers the barrier for small companies to start AEO tracking.  \n* **Competitor Benchmarking:** Peec enables side-by-side **competitor visibility comparisons**. It automatically labels and groups citations by domain and content type, aiming to show which competitor content pieces are getting cited by AI[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=Peec%20tries%20to%20help%20you,in%20the%20most%20helpful%20way). This helps marketers identify content gaps: for example, if rivals’ blog articles or listicles are being cited for a query and yours aren’t, you’ve spotted an opportunity. Peec also tracks sentiment of mentions (are AI references to your brand positive, neutral, or negative), which is valuable for PR and brand reputation monitoring[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms).  \n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* **Shallow Automation, Few Integrations:** Peec’s strength is tracking, but it offers little beyond data. It lacks deeper content analytics or integration with web analytics/log data. Analysts note that Peec provides limited “backend” analysis – there’s no log-file AI crawler data or GA4 integration as you’d find in enterprise tools[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,Limited%20backend%20or%20log%20analysis). Essentially, you get the **surface metrics** (who’s mentioned where), but not much insight into *why* or how to directly act on it.  \n* **Clunky Data Labeling:** While Peec tries to auto-label citation sources (identifying a result as a “blog post”, “listicle”, “docs site”, etc.), its taxonomy is one-dimensional and often incomplete[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=Peec%20tries%20to%20help%20you,in%20the%20most%20helpful%20way). A single piece of content often fits multiple categories (an article that is both a listicle and a comparison), but Peec will tag it as only one, leading to incomplete data labeling[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=URL%20and%20domain%20typologies%20are,that%20in%20an%20exported%20spreadsheet). There’s no way to fix these labels in-app, so meaningful analysis may require exporting data and manually cleaning it[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=means%20your%20data%20is%20almost,that%20in%20an%20exported%20spreadsheet). This can be time-consuming, undercutting the “automation” promise.  \n* **No Content Creation Features:** Importantly, Peec does **not help create or optimize content** – it’s purely a tracking tool. Users must take the insights and go elsewhere to produce content. This means Peec addresses the “monitoring” side of AEO but leaves the “optimization” entirely up to you.  \n\n**Ideal Use Case:** Peec is a solid entry-level AEO tracker for **budget-conscious teams** that want to dip their toes in AI visibility monitoring[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=AEO%20Score%3A%2049%2F100). A small business or agency can use Peec to prove the concept of AI search tracking – show a client how often they vs. competitors appear in AI answers – without a big investment. However, larger enterprises with advanced needs (multi-language data, compliance, or integration into content workflows) may outgrow Peec quickly. It’s a useful alert system to **understand brand presence**, but you’ll need additional strategy and tools to act on the data and improve that presence.\n\n# Profound (TryProfound) – Enterprise-Grade AI Visibility Platform\n\nProfound is widely regarded as the **enterprise leader** in AEO platforms. In independent rankings it often comes out on top – Overthink Group’s hands-on evaluation ranked Profound #1 for AI visibility tools[overthinkgroup.com](https://overthinkgroup.com/best-ai-visibility-tools/#profound-review#:~:text=The%20Best%20AI%20Visibility%20Tools,sentiment%20analysis%2C%20decent%20parameter%20definition), and a recent analysis gave it the highest “AEO Score” (92/100) of any platform in 2025[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Top%20AI%20Visibility%20Platforms%20by,AEO%20Score). Profound positions itself as a **comprehensive AI visibility and optimization suite** built for large organizations. It combines multiple data sources and capabilities: prompt result tracking, AI crawler log analysis, content performance analytics, and even compliance features[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=G2%20Winter%202026%20AEO%20Leader%3A,Answer%20Engine%20Optimization%29%20category).\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Deep Data and Insights:** Profound offers richer data than perhaps any competitor. It doesn’t rely only on front-end prompt scraping; it also uses **server-side and log-level data**. For example, Profound ingest logs of AI crawlers hitting your site to show what content LLMs have indexed[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control). It has a *Conversation Explorer* that reveals actual user questions being asked on AI platforms (like a keyword research tool for ChatGPT queries)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=When%20we%20first%20started%20looking,with%20AI%20chatbots%20like%20ChatGPT). And it tracks citations across at least **10 major AI engines** – from GPT-4/5 and Google’s various AI modes to Perplexity, Claude, Meta AI, and more. The platform correlates this data into an **AEO Score** that factors citation frequency, prominence, domain authority, content freshness, structured data usage, etc., giving enterprises a singular KPI for AI visibility. In short, Profound provides a *360° view* of how AI sees and uses your content.  \n* **Enterprise Features (Security, Scale, Integrations):** As an enterprise tool, Profound checks all the boxes for security and scale. It’s SOC 2 Type II certified and even HIPAA compliant, allowing use in regulated industries like healthcare[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=HIPAA%20Compliance%3A%20Profound%20achieved%20HIPAA,AEO%20while%20maintaining%20regulatory%20compliance). It supports multilingual tracking and analysis (30+ languages) for global companies[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=GCP%20Integration%3A%20Agent%20Analytics%20now,hosted%20content). Integrations are a strong point: Profound can pipe data into Google Analytics (GA4) to attribute AI-sourced traffic[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=The%20gold%20standard%20for%20enterprise,tracking%2C%20and%20deep%20technical%20control), and it offers plugins for CMS like WordPress to monitor AI crawler behavior on your site[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Optimization%29%20category). These features make it easier for large teams to incorporate AEO data into their existing marketing tech stack.  \n* **Continuous Innovation:** Backed by substantial funding (a $35M Series B led by Sequoia Capital[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Prompt%20Volumes%20Dataset%3A%20Built%20on,people%20are%20asking%20AI%20systems)), Profound is rapidly adding features. Recent updates in late 2025 include tracking of the latest models (OpenAI GPT-5.2) across the suite[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Recent%20Platform%20Enhancements%3A), new **Profound Workflows** to automate content audits and optimizations for AI search[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=responses%20in%20dashboards%20now%20reflect,OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20most%20advanced%20frontier%20model), and even a **“Profound Index” leaderboard that ranks brands by how often they appear in AI answers**[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=retailers%20visibility%20into%20conversational%20commerce). This pace of innovation solidifies its position as a category leader and signals that it keeps pace with the fast-moving AI landscape.  \n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* **Cost and Complexity:** Profound is built for large enterprises, and its pricing and complexity reflect that. While exact pricing isn’t public, it starts in the hundreds of dollars per month range (HogTheWeb notes pricing from $199/mo and up)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20Profound%E2%80%99s%20focus,It%E2%80%99s%20a%20bit%20like), and likely much higher for full enterprise licenses. The platform’s numerous features may be overkill for small teams – it’s a **heavyweight tool** that assumes you have the resources (and expertise) to leverage advanced analytics and integrations. Smaller businesses might find it too complex, both in implementation and in interpreting the deluge of data it provides.  \n* **Not an All-in-One Marketer’s Tool:** Profound excels at **diagnostics** – showing where you stand in AI search – but it doesn’t by itself create content or manage your content workflow. It will tell you, for example, that Competitor X’s listicle is cited more often than your equivalent page for a given prompt, or that your share of voice in “AI overviews” is low for a topic[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=tracking%20across%20major%20AI%20platforms,narrative%20across%20various%20AI%20platforms). Acting on that insight (i.e., creating new content or revamping pages) is left to your team. In that sense, Profound is a specialized *analytics and tracking* platform. Enterprises will still need to pair it with a strong content marketing operation to see actual results. (Notably, Profound has introduced workflow features to audit and optimize content[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=responses%20in%20dashboards%20now%20reflect,OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20most%20advanced%20frontier%20model), but it’s more assistive than generative – it streamlines human work, rather than writing content for you.)  \n\n**Ideal Use Case:** Profound is the **best fit for large enterprises and data-driven marketing teams** that demand precision and depth. If you are in a **regulated or security-conscious industry** (finance, healthcare, etc.) or need to monitor AI visibility across many international markets, Profound is built for you[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Series%20B%20from%20Sequoia%20Capital,the%20Profound%20Sales%20team%20%E2%86%92)[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=GCP%20Integration%3A%20Agent%20Analytics%20now,hosted%20content). These organizations typically have the budget and in-house experts to take advantage of Profound’s advanced features. It helps them uncover granular insights – e.g. exactly which content pieces to update, how AI crawlers are behaving, and whether changes lead to improved citations. For a lean startup or solo marketer, however, Profound would likely be overwhelming and costly. They might instead opt for lighter solutions or all-in-one tools that include content creation.\n\n# AirOps – Workflow Automation from Insight to Content\n\nAirOps is a unique player in this space, positioning itself not just as an AI visibility tracker but as an **AI-powered content operations platform**. It’s designed for marketing teams that want to integrate AEO insights directly into their content creation and optimization processes. In other words, AirOps goes a step further than pure tracking: it helps you **take action** on the data at scale[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=AirOps%20helps%20teams%20win%20AI,search)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Take%20precise%20action). The platform combines features of an AEO tracker (monitoring where you show up in AI search) with an automation toolkit to produce and update content (often termed “content engineering”).\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n\n* **Integrated AEO + SEO Workflows:** AirOps allows users to build multi-step **workflows** that tie together research, content generation, and optimization tasks. A simple example: identify questions where a competitor is cited but you are not (visibility insight) → fetch that competitor’s content → use an LLM to analyze gaps → generate an improved piece of content or brief. These workflows are constructed in a visual interface (drag-and-drop), connecting steps like a Google Search query, a web scraper, and an LLM prompt into a sequence[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=AirOps%20has%20two%20core%20components)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Grids%20). Once a workflow (the “recipe”) is set up, AirOps lets you run it at scale across many inputs via **Grids**, analogous to applying a function across rows in a spreadsheet[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Grids%20)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Build%20the%20recipe,Workflow). This system turns what used to be one-off prompt fiddling into a **repeatable, scalable process**. As one reviewer put it, *“Prompts save minutes. Workflows save hours. Grids save whole weeks.”*[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=AirOps%20turns%20SEO%2FAEO%20into%20something,Article%20%E2%86%92%20Optimization%E2%80%A6%20all%20automated)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Workflows%20beat%20prompts,Grids%20save%20whole%20weeks) – underscoring that AirOps helps teams move beyond ad-hoc prompting to systematic content production.  \n* **From Insight to Action:** AirOps is often praised for closing the loop between seeing a visibility gap and filling it. It provides **visibility insights** similar to other AEO tools – e.g. showing which questions your audience is asking, where your brand or others are mentioned, and your content’s citation rank[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=See%20where%20you%20stand). But critically, it then *tells you what to do* and enables you to do it. The platform can surface a list of “opportunities” – for instance, topics or specific queries where competitors are winning – each coupled with a suggested action like *“refresh your existing article on X with Y info”*[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Surface%20your%20highest%20leverage%20opportunities). Users can then execute that action inside AirOps: update content or generate new content with the help of AI models, and publish it (it supports CMS integrations and direct publishing)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Take%20precise%20action). By monitoring results over time, AirOps creates a feedback loop so you can watch your AI visibility score improve as you implement its recommendations[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Once%20you%20know%20what%20to,your%20brand%20visibility%20score%20rise). This **insight-to-execution pipeline** is AirOps’ hallmark, designed to *drive pipeline and results, not just produce reports*[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=Visibility%20insights%20are%20just%20the,Only%20action%20drives%20pipeline)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=AirOps%20helps%20teams%20win%20AI,search).  \n* **Training and “Content Engineering” Focus:** A distinguishing aspect of AirOps is its emphasis on upskilling marketers to become “Content Engineers.” The company provides an educational platform (AirOps University) to teach users how to design effective AI-driven content systems[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/win-ai-search-turn-visibility-into-action#:~:text=The%20best%20teams%20win%20by,adapting%20content%20strategies%20at%20scale)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=You%20might%20assume%20reviews%20are,me%20something%20more%20valuable%3A%20skills). The idea of *content engineering* is treating content creation like building a machine – designing repeatable systems that can produce high-quality content at scale, rather than writing each piece manually[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=So,Content%20Engineer)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=You%20go%20from%20chef%20%E2%86%92,kitchen%20designer). For teams willing to invest time in this approach, AirOps can be transformative. It effectively turns content marketing into a more technical, automated operation (the analogy used: moving from being the chef to designing the kitchen)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=engineers,Let%E2%80%99s%20start%20with%20a%20story)[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=It%20turns%20insights%20into%20action,Without%20drama). This is especially powerful for agencies or large content teams who need to output a lot of AI-optimized content efficiently, while maintaining consistency and quality.  \n\n**Target Audience:** AirOps is best suited for **marketing teams and agencies** that have significant content production needs and are ready to embrace automation. It’s a platform for those who want to *not only see where they stand* in AI search, but systematically **do something about it** across their whole site or client portfolio. Enterprises that want to unify traditional SEO and AEO efforts may find AirOps appealing – it explicitly aims to bridge SEO and AI visibility in one system[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/blog/organic-search-marketing#:~:text=AirOps%20www,optimization%2C%20and%20scalable%20content%20workflows)[airops.com](https://www.airops.com/insights#:~:text=AirOps%20Insights%20,Support). On the other hand, solo founders or very small teams might find AirOps’ robust platform a bit overwhelming or beyond their immediate needs. It often requires a shift in mindset (learning workflows, etc.) and possibly a higher budget (pricing is custom or via demo, indicating a focus on larger accounts). For those smaller players, a more out-of-the-box solution could be preferable – which is where our next vendor, [Outwrite.ai](http://Outwrite.ai), comes in.\n\n# [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) – End-to-End AEO for Content Creation (Top Pick for SMBs)\n\n[**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **stands out as an all-in-one AEO solution** that is particularly well-suited for solo founders, small businesses, and lean marketing teams. Unlike other platforms that emphasize only tracking or only point solutions, Outwrite was built with the philosophy that *“creating the content is more important than just tracking prompts.”* It combines **prompt-based AI visibility tracking, competitive research, AI content generation, and even one-click publishing** into a single affordable package[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Research%20%E2%86%92%20Create%20%E2%86%92%20Publish,%E2%86%92%20Get%20Cited%20%E2%86%92%20Track)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Publish%20%26%20Get%20Cited). This end-to-end approach addresses the core problem we discussed earlier: the need to close the gap between insight and action. With Outwrite, users can go from identifying a visibility gap to having new content published to fill that gap in literally minutes, not weeks[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=How%20It%20Works)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=AI%20Creates%20Better%20Content).\n\n**Key Features and Advantages:**\n\n* **“Research → Create → Publish → Track” Workflow:** Outwrite guides users through a four-step process within one platform[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Research%20%E2%86%92%20Create%20%E2%86%92%20Publish,%E2%86%92%20Get%20Cited%20%E2%86%92%20Track). First, you **Discover Citation Opportunities** by either scanning your website or entering a topic; Outwrite will show which questions in AI search your content (or your competitors’ content) is being cited for, and what content is winning those citations[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Discover%20Citation%20Opportunities). Next, **AI Creates Better Content** – Outwrite’s AI uses the insights to generate a superior, citation-optimized article or post in under 60 seconds[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=AI%20Creates%20Better%20Content). You can then **Publish** the content with one click (direct integrations to WordPress, Shopify, and even auto-formatted outputs for channels like Reddit or LinkedIn are provided)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Publish%20%26%20Get%20Cited). Finally, Outwrite **Tracks Your AI Visibility** over time, monitoring how the new content gains citations on platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=One,AI%20systems%20cite%20your%20expertise). This closed-loop system means even a one-person team can continuously improve AI visibility without juggling multiple tools.  \n* **Content Optimized for AI (and SEO):** Outwrite is keenly focused on generating content that *AI models want to cite*. It analyzes what currently gets cited and then produces content with those patterns – for instance, including concise Q&amp;A sections, factual snippets, schema markup, and other **LLM-friendly structures**[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Optimized%20for%20AI%20Citations)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Q%26A%20sections%2C%20answer%20fragments%2C%20and,for%20AI%20retrieval%20and%20citation). The platform boasts “perfect schema every time” (automatically added structured data), which is critical since well-structured content is easier for AI to parse and trust[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over). At the same time, Outwrite adheres to Google’s E-E-A-T guidelines and claims the AI-written pieces will also perform in traditional search without penalty[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Win%20Both%20Google%20Search%20AND,AI%20Citations). This dual optimization for SEO and AEO can save small teams from having to rewrite AI content for Google – a significant benefit as it avoids trade-offs between ranking on Google and getting cited by ChatGPT.  \n* **Affordable Pricing for SMBs:** Outwrite has a transparent, self-serve pricing model that is much lower than typical enterprise tools. For example, the **Essentials plan is $97/month** and includes 15 AI-written articles/posts per month plus tracking of 10 prompts and basic visibility analytics[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Essentials)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Models%20run%205%2C000%20times%2Fmonth). Even the “Starter” tier at $197/mo allows up to 40 articles and more tracked prompts[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Starter)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Models%20run%2012%2C500%20times%2Fmonth). This pricing is within reach of solo entrepreneurs and small businesses, especially considering it could replace several separate services (content writers, SEO tools, and AEO trackers all in one). By lowering cost and complexity, Outwrite positions itself as *“the first to track, research, create, and publish”* in one tool – as one commenter quipped, “Game over.”[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Just%20visit%20www,Game%20over). For SMB users who can’t afford enterprise platforms or large content teams, this all-in-one value proposition is extremely compelling.  \n* **Results and Use Cases:** Early indicators show Outwrite’s approach can yield significant gains in AI visibility. Outwrite reports that average users have seen **1500%+ increases in clicks from ChatGPT** in \\~60 days of use[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenEngineOptimization/comments/1o1jmyw/how_are_you_measuring_ai_visibility_in_2025_are/#:~:text=Wordpress%20and%20Shopify%20integrations%2C%20Reddit,Game%20over). While that figure likely varies, it underscores the advantage of acting quickly on opportunities – something Outwrite enables. Additionally, Outwrite can host a blog for customers who don’t even have one (via a simple code embed)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Create%20content%20AI%20models%20want,to%20cite)[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Blog%20Hosting%20Included), removing another barrier for a solo founder to start publishing AI-optimized content. Case studies (like “Danish Lead Co.” on their site) claim first client wins from AI search within weeks of using Outwrite[outwrite.ai](https://outwrite.ai/#:~:text=Danish%20Lead%20Co). All this supports the idea that the **speed and integration** Outwrite offers can translate to real business outcomes fast.  \n\n**Why** [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **is the Top Choice for Small Teams:** The neutral analysis above highlights that many AEO tools stop at tracking, leaving users with data but no direct solution. [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) **breaks that mold** by ensuring the creation of content is baked into the workflow. For solo founders and small marketing teams, this is a game-changer – it’s like having an SEO strategist, content writer, and AEO analyst all in one app. It addresses the core reason “prompt tracking alone” can fail: without new content, your visibility won’t improve. Outwrite essentially automates *the hard part – creating and publishing quality content targeted at the right gaps – at a fraction of the cost of hiring an agency or multiple specialists*. This makes AEO attainable for those who have more ambition than budget. While enterprises may still require the depth of a Profound or the custom workflows of AirOps, **for most small and mid-size businesses Outwrite offers the best balance of functionality, simplicity, and affordability** to actually *move the needle*. It’s an end-to-end growth tool in the AEO era, not just a report generator.\n\n# Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe AEO vendor landscape in 2025 is vibrant and evolving quickly, but also **skewed toward two extremes**. On one end, enterprise-focused platforms (like Profound, and to some extent AirOps) deliver exhaustive data and powerful automation, yet they assume you have a team and resources to leverage them. On the other end, several tools only tackle *visibility tracking* in isolation (Peec and others), which, while useful for awareness, don’t directly help you improve your standing. As our analysis shows, simply knowing your “AI visibility score” isn’t enough – you need to **increase** that visibility by creating content that AI will cite[nicklafferty.com](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/best-ai-visibility-optimization-platforms/#:~:text=Takeaway%3A%20Classic%20SEO%20metrics%20don%E2%80%99t,clear%2C%20factual%2C%20and%20relevant%20answers). Chasing prompt metrics alone, without feeding the AI new high-quality answers about your brand, is indeed a dead-end strategy.\n\nFor enterprise marketing leaders, the takeaway is to be strategic: use these tools to identify content opportunities, but ensure you have a content engine ready to act on them. A combination of platforms might even be warranted (e.g. using Profound for deep analysis and AirOps or internal processes for content workflow automation). Remember that AEO success still boils down to fundamentals: understand your audience’s questions and deliver the best answers, formatted for AI consumption[forrester.com](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/how-to-master-answer-engine-optimization/#:~:text=1,more%20visible%20in%20answer%20engines)[hogtheweb.com](https://hogtheweb.com/top-prompt-mining-tools/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20AI%20answers,Answer%20Engine%20Optimization). Tools can accelerate the research and monitoring, but human judgment is needed to prioritize and strategize effectively.\n\nFor **solo founders and small businesses**, the emergence of end-to-end solutions like [Outwrite.ai](http://Outwrite.ai) is promising. They level the playing field by automating sophisticated AEO tactics (from prompt mining to content publishing) that a tiny team could hardly do manually. If you’re a small player, focusing on a tool that helps you **create AI-optimized content** will likely yield more ROI than one that only audits your current (possibly sparse) content. In a sense, *content is the currency* in the AEO/AI search era – the brands that consistently produce useful, cite-worthy content will “train” the AI to recommend them. Invest accordingly.\n\nIn summary, AEO is rapidly becoming as essential as SEO for anyone concerned with digital visibility. The vendors discussed each address pieces of this puzzle: **Peec** for basic visibility tracking, **Profound** for enterprise-grade insight and control, **AirOps** for workflow automation and scaling, and [**Outwrite.ai**](http://Outwrite.ai) for a complete creation-to-tracking cycle. While each has merit, we emphasize that **the real win is in closing the loop** – using insights to drive content actions. Those who do so will turn AI search from a threat (stealing clicks) into an opportunity (new audience reach). As one industry expert succinctly put it, *“You don’t need to write faster – you need better ways to produce content”*[lauradecastro.substack.com](https://lauradecastro.substack.com/p/30-scaling-content-in-the-ai-search#:~:text=Before%20we%20go%20deeper%2C%20here%E2%80%99s,the%20core%20lesson). The right AEO tools, used in the right way, will help you do exactly that, ensuring that when the machines answer questions, **your brand is the answer they recommend**.",

    "text": "How My Work as a Counselor Changed My View on Determinism\n# Background\n\nAbout eight or nine years ago, I first heard Sam Harris dismantle the concept of free will. \n\nBefore that, I'm not really sure what I would've said if someone asked what I believe. But I was definitely \"primed\" to accept his premise. I had always felt retribution lacked justification, viewed behaviour as the result of biopsychosocial interactions, and my father (a hippie, let's say) taught me about eastern philosophy from a young age. \n\nSo while the insight felt novel and profound, it didn't really bother me as it does some: I was not *shaken*, perhaps just a bit *stirred*. Even so, in the following years this deterministic view significantly influenced my understanding of human behavior.\n\nIn the years since then, I've read/listened to a lot on the topic, including many defenses of Compatibilism, like the Harris vs. Dennett debate and even posts on this subreddit. To me it always felt like an ad hoc cop-out: a reluctant admittance of the \"fact\" of Determinism, but an emotional refusal to accept the conclusion of the premise.\n\n# My Clinical Experience\n\n2.5 years ago I started working in addiction treatment as a counselor (I'm a trained social worker, *not* a therapist)\n\nI was trained to rely on methods like Motivational Interviewing and CBT (happily so, they are useful tools). But since Sam's message on the nature of the mind, determinism etc had been so significant for me, personally and intellectually, I spent a lot of time wondering if there were lessons I could integrate into my counseling while still staying professional and grounded (I don't think my employer would say \"Hey, just go on a silent retreat and take some LSD\" is appropriate advice lol). \n\nI was trying to reconcile my clinical reality with my intellectual certainty. I knew that the person sitting next to me had no \"free will\" to simply \"just say no.\" However, I realized how volatile this message could be for a mind corrupted by addiction. Telling clients how they were victims of prior/external causes and opaque brain chemistry... That would just be me detailing just how inescapable their situation is, then expecting them to escape.\n\nThis left me with two beliefs:\n\n* Philosophically, free will is an illusion that obfuscates many necessary truths. \n* Clinically, it is necessary to embrace free will-related concepts like agency, self-efficacy, Locus of Control, and personal responsibility. \n\nI know these aren't incompatible *per se*, but it still felt like a paradox of sorts, that I didn't know how to navigate. Over time I found that the best strategy was just to lean into this paradox fully. Let me illustrate with an example monologue. This is not how I'd say it verbatum (English isn't even my native language), but it is based on a real conversation.\n\n&gt;You told me that sometimes you feel you don't deserve a better life, because you've done so many mistakes.\n\n&gt;At the same time, you've told me about your upbringing, \\[trauma A, injustice B\\]. Of course all that has had an effect on you, it would for anyone. Blaming yourself just feeds into this cycle of negativity that makes change harder. \n\n&gt;It's not so easy to make good choices if you were never given the tools to make them. You didn't \"choose\" to become addicted. You didn't choose your genes or environment, and I believe that's what shapes a persons behavior. \n\n&gt;These are the cards you've been dealt, and the game was rigged against you. You must have some self-compassion for how you ended up in this. At the same time, just feeling sorry for yourself helps about as much as blaming yourself for past mistakes. You need change.\n\n&gt;It wasn't your choice to get addicted, but you can choose sobriety *\\[This is the \"paradox\"\\]*. And even then, you know it's not easy. We will support you as best we can, but the hard reality is that you are the only one who can get yourself out of this. It's not your fault, but it's your responsibility. That's not fair, but such is life. The good news is it's possible to win even with a bad hand.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* **Self-compassion for the Past (Determinism).** In addiction, shame is often the fuel that keeps the cycle burning.\n* **Agency for the Future (Free will).** Research shows that an internal *Locus of Control* (believing you influence outcomes) is associated with many positive outcomes, including the capacity for behavioral change\n* **Fault vs. Responsibility in the Present.** \n\nI'm very likely trying to reinvent the wheel here: this framework is not exactly revolutionary and I think therapists have been doing this intuitively for decades. But for me it highlights that the regardless of the *\"truth\"* of Free Will, it can be useful in certain contexts. \n\nIt wasn't until recently that I realized this view actually takes me closer to compatibilism than hard determinism.\n\n# A necessary illusion?\n\nIn Alex O'Connors conversation with Sam, he asked (from memory):\n\n\"What if it were shown to be objectively true that a false belief (e.g. in God) is the most effective and reliable way maximize well-being?\"\n\nSam's reponded with some variation of a famous line of his: \"Is it *required* that you believe in anything on insufficient evidence to live a meaningful, moral, and happy life?\". I agree with Sam that is indeed highly implausible.\n\nLet's compare this to free will. For this, I'd rephrase the question as: **is a belief in free will necessary to function and be moral?**\n\nWe must of course distinguish between *conviction* and *experience*. Obviously you don't need to be *convinced* there is free will to function and be moral: Sam Harris and Robert Sapolsky seem like pretty wholesome dudes.\n\nBut do you need to *experience* free will in your day-to-day life to function? The answer, whether one likes it or not, is **Yes**.\n\nSo let me pull a Jordan Peterson: *What do we mean by \"believe\"?* \n\nIf \"belief\" means acting as if something is true, then we are all believers when we aren't actively trying not to be. Although Free Will may be viewed differently in different cultures/traditions (e.g. Buddhism), I believe a sense of agency to be the \"natural subjective state\" of animalistic conciousness. Even Sam would admit that it is not possible to live your life and never ascribe agency. We cannot function psychologically or socially if we view every action as a pre-determined collision of atoms. \n\nObjectively, atoms have no color, they only reflect wavelengths of light. But that's just a fact about physics, it doesn't help you if you are a driver at a traffic light. You can not reach your end goal if you don't perceive the illusion. At a certain point, doesn't the philosophical abstraction yield to the biological imperative?\n\n# So where do we land?\n\nI don't know.. Is there a middle ground I can land comfortably?\n\nOne attempt to mediate between compatibilism and hard determinism is *semicompatibilism*. It asserts that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism, while remaining agnostic about whether free will (the capacity to choose differently) is. \"It's probably not your fault, but you're still to blame\". As moral accountability is not really my primary concern here, that's doesn't really do it for me.\n\nAnother attempt is [*illusionism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusionism_(free_will)). It holds that free will is an illusion, but it \"is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society\"\n\nThat's... a bit drastic, though certainly more interesting. For me, there is no clear moral imperative to either dismantle or defend free will. It is an illusion with basis in biological reality, with pros and cons. The cons are severe (retribution, egoism, hatred), which tells me it needs to be *questioned and criticized*, the fact that is inescapable (and has some pros, e.g. for agency and motivation) tells me there is not much use in trying to rid ourselves of it fully, like hard determinists typically argue.  \n\nIt reminds me of how some gender relativists want to completely \"dissolve gender norms.\" We can try, but what do we do about the fact that there are biological sex differences and an innate tendency to construct and uphold norms? Oh you don't believe in biology? Okay, good for you...\n\nI'll try to conclude with this. Perhaps the ultimate task isn't to shatter the illusion, but to cultivate the wisdom to know when to question it and when to let it be, recognizing that while the universe operates on cause and effect, a meaningful life requires us to act as if our choices matter, even as we occasionally step back to remember they don't.",

    "text": "What Are The Pros And Cons Of Fostering?\nThe Pros and Cons of Fostering: Understanding the Impact on Families and Children\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFostering is a noble commitment that provides a temporary home for children who are unable to live with their birth families. It's a chance to offer love and support to children in need. However, the decision to foster comes with its own set of pros and cons. Understanding these factors can help families decide whether fostering is the right choice for them.\n\n### Benefits of Fostering\n\nFostering offers various advantages that can be both rewarding and fulfilling for individuals and families. Here are some of the key benefits:\n\n- **Making a Positive Impact:** One of the most significant pros of fostering is the ability to change a child's life. By providing a safe and nurturing environment, you can help a child heal from trauma and build a brighter future.\n- **Building Connections:** Fostering allows families to form deep connections. You not only create a bond with the child but also with their biological family, social workers, and other support networks.\n- **Learning and Growth:** Both foster parents and children experience personal growth. Parents gain insight into different life experiences, while children learn new skills and coping mechanisms.\n- **Flexibility:** Fostering can often be tailored to fit your family's situation. From short-term to long-term placements, you can choose the type of fostering that works best for you.\n- **Financial Support:** Many fostering programs offer financial assistance to help with the costs of raising a child. This support can alleviate some of the financial burdens that come with fostering.\n\n### Challenges of Fostering\n\nWhile there are numerous benefits, fostering also involves challenges that potential foster parents should consider. Here are some of the notable drawbacks:\n\n- **Emotional Strain:** Fostering can be emotionally demanding. Children may come with trauma and baggage, which can be difficult for both the child and foster family to navigate.\n- **Uncertainty:** The fostering process can be unpredictable. Children may leave your home at any time, which can lead to feelings of loss and uncertainty for both parties.\n- **Behavioral Issues:** Some foster children may show challenging behaviors due to their past experiences. Managing these behaviors can require patience and specialized strategies.\n- **Time Commitment:** Fostering requires a significant time investment. Attending court hearings, family visits, and therapy sessions can take up a lot of time and energy.\n- **Need for Support:** Often, foster families need additional support and resources to assist with the challenges they face. Finding a strong support network is crucial to navigating the hurdles of fostering.\n\n### Potential Impact on Biological Children\n\nFostering not only affects the foster child but can also influence biological children in the home. Giving your biological kids the opportunity to foster teaches them valuable lessons about compassion and empathy. However, it is essential to communicate openly with them about the process. Here are some considerations:\n\n- **Increased Responsibility:** Your biological children may need to take on additional responsibilities to help care for the foster child, fostering teamwork within the family.\n- **Emotional Adjustment:** Biological children may struggle with sharing attention and may feel jealousy or fear. It's critical to address their feelings and provide reassurance throughout the process.\n- **Life Lessons:** They will learn about resilience, selflessness, and the complexities of family dynamics, which can be beneficial for their development.\n\nUltimately, fostering is a deeply rewarding but complex experience. Understanding the pros and cons, as well as the impact it can have on the family and the children involved, is essential. If you are contemplating fostering, take the time to reflect on your family's capacity to embrace and support a child in need. With open hearts and minds, fostering can be a transformative journey for everyone involved.\n\nHow Fostering Can Transform Lives: Personal Stories and Testimonials\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFostering is more than just a temporary arrangement; it is a profound commitment that can change lives for the better. Many children come into foster care feeling hopeless, lost, and alone. However, stories from foster families and children show that love and support can spark transformation. Let’s explore some of these uplifting personal stories and testimonials, and discover just how impactful fostering can be.\n\nOne foster parent, Jessica, shares her journey, “When my husband and I decided to become foster parents, we were expecting challenges, but we never predicted the depth of joy it would bring into our lives. We welcomed a five-year-old boy named Liam, who was shy and scared at first. With time, trust blossomed. I remember the day he smiled for the first time, it was like the sun breaking through the clouds.” Stories like Jessica's highlight how foster care can nurture a child’s confidence and well-being.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \nFor many children, being placed in a loving home is a significant turning point. Take the story of Ethan, who entered the system at a young age. His foster mother, Maria, recalls, “He arrived at our home filled with anxiety. After a few weeks of caring for him, he slowly opened up. He started to smile again and even asked me to read him stories at night.” Such connections form the foundation for healing and personal growth.\n\nFostering offers children a sense of stability during turbulent times. This transition can drastically alter a child's emotions and outlook. Here are a few key benefits foster children may experience:\n\n- **Emotional Healing:** With dedicated support, many children learn to cope with their past trauma.\n- **Building Resilience:** Through consistent love, children develop skills to face future challenges.\n- **Education Opportunities:** Foster homes often prioritize education, helping children recover lost academic ground.\n- **Life Skills:** Foster parents mentor children in daily tasks, preparing them for independence.\n\nAside from the direct benefits to children, foster families often find themselves transformed. Adam and Lily, a young couple, share, “Fostering has reshaped our perspective on life. Our foster daughter, Mia, taught us patience and selflessness. Her resilience in the face of adversity inspired us to appreciate every moment.” This experience not only impacts the child but also enriches the lives of the caregivers.\n\nThe journey is not always easy. There are heartaches and difficult days, but the rewards often outweigh the challenges. Many foster parents note how these experiences have deepened their understanding of compassion and family. One family describes their time with Jordan, who was initially withdrawn but gradually opened up. “With each small victory, like him sharing his favorite toy, we felt our hearts grow larger. He became part of our family,” they recounted.\n\nMoreover, fostering can lead to lasting relationships that go beyond the immediate caregiving period. “Even after my foster son, David, moved on to a permanent home, we have remained in contact,” explains Kelly, a foster mom. “It’s wonderful to see him thriving, and I cherish our bond while knowing I played a part in his journey.” This kind of connection exemplifies how fostering creates a network of support and love that can persist beyond traditional family ties.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \nMany organizations actively promote fostering, enlightening potential foster parents about the impact they can have. Programs ensure new foster families feel equipped for the role with detailed training and supportive resources. Such initiatives have been invaluable for helping families navigate the complexities of providing care.\n\nUltimately, fostering can transform lives—both for children seeking a safe haven and the families who welcome them. It is an ongoing journey filled with challenges, but also overwhelming rewards. As you hear more personal accounts from those involved in fostering, remember that every story highlights the hope and healing that can arise from opening your heart and home. Whether you are considering fostering or simply seeking to understand its profound impact, these heartfelt testimonials reveal the beauty of this often-overlooked act of love. Together, we can champion change and make a difference in the lives of those who need it the most.\n\nKey Considerations for Potential Foster Parents: What You Need to Know\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBecoming a foster parent is a profound decision that can lead to life-changing experiences for both the child and the caregiver. If you're considering this path, it’s important to reflect on several key factors that will not only affect your experience but also shape the life of the child you’ll be caring for.\n\n### Understanding the Commitment\n\nFostering is not just a temporary arrangement; it often requires a long-term commitment. These children may come from challenging backgrounds and may need time to trust and adjust. Therefore, it’s essential to assess your availability, patience, and emotional strength before you dive in. Be ready to provide a safe and loving environment in which the child can heal and thrive.\n\n### Stable Environment\n\nYour home environment plays a crucial role in fostering. Create a welcoming and stable setting that prioritizes comfort and safety. Consider the following:\n\n- Childproof any hazardous areas in your home.\n- Ensure there’s a suitable space for the child, such as a bedroom decorated to make them feel at home.\n- Maintain a routine that helps the child feel secure.\n\nA calming atmosphere not only assists the child’s emotional well-being but also provides a positive environment for their growth.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \n### Financial Readiness\n\nFostering does involve costs. While foster families receive financial support, there are still expenses that may arise. It's prudent to understand these financial responsibilities ahead of time. Evaluate the following:\n\n- Costs related to clothing, school supplies, and extracurricular activities.\n- Potential medical and dental expenses.\n- Need for any special therapeutic services depending on the child's background.\n\nBeing financially prepared will allow you to focus on providing the best possible care for the child.\n\n### Legal and Regulatory Knowledge\n\nFostering involves navigating a complex web of legal responsibilities. Familiarize yourself with local laws and the rights of foster children. Understanding the child welfare system will help you advocate better for the rights and needs of the child in your care. Don’t hesitate to reach out to local agencies for guidance and resources.\n\n### Support Systems\n\nTransitioning into fostering can be a challenging journey. Building a strong support system is essential. Here are some options:\n\n- Connect with other foster families who can share their experiences and advice.\n- Look for local support groups or forums online.\n- Consider talking to a counselor or therapist for any psychological support you may need.\n\nEmotional support for both you and the child will enhance the fostering experience significantly.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \n### Emotional Preparedness\n\nFostering can evoke a range of emotions, from joy to frustration. Prepare yourself for the possibility of bonding with a child, only to see them leave your home. This can be difficult, so ensure you have coping strategies in place. Consider the following:\n\n- Practice self-care to manage stress and emotional fatigue.\n- Set realistic expectations about your role in the child’s life.\n- Establish open lines of communication with the child to build trust.\n\nYour ability to process these feelings will not only help you but will also model emotional resilience for the child.\n\n### Understanding the Child’s Needs\n\nEach child in foster care comes with a unique background and set of needs. Some may have experienced trauma, while others might struggle with emotional or behavioral issues. Take time to learn about these potential challenges and how to address them effectively. Be open to learning about:\n\n- The child's past experiences and how they affect their present behavior.\n- Specific strategies to help them feel secure and understood.\n- Resources available for children dealing with trauma, such as therapy or counseling services.\n\nBy being proactive in understanding these needs, you can create a nurturing and supportive environment.\n\nTaking on the role of a foster parent is both rewarding and challenging. By considering these key aspects, you can better prepare yourself for this incredible journey. It's essential to reflect deeply on your motivations and readiness to make a lasting difference in a child's life.\n\nNavigating the Challenges of Foster Care: Support Systems and Resources\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFoster care can be a challenging journey filled with numerous emotional, social, and practical considerations. However, each challenge can be navigated more effectively with the proper support systems and resources. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone involved in fostering, whether you're a foster parent, a child in care, or an advocate.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \nOne of the primary challenges fostering families face is the emotional strain that comes from caring for children with traumatic backgrounds. These children may struggle with attachment issues, behavioral problems, or have experienced loss and changes in their lives. To counteract these issues, it’s important to have a reliable support network in place. This can include friends, family, and neighbors who understand the unique demands of fostering. Sometimes, simply having someone to talk to can make a significant difference in managing stress and feelings of isolation.\n\nIn addition, formal support systems are essential. Many local foster care agencies provide training programs that help foster families learn effective parenting strategies tailored for children who have experienced trauma. These programs often cover topics such as:\n\n- Understanding the effects of trauma on behavior\n- Effective communication strategies\n- Building trust and attachment\n- Self-care techniques for foster parents\n\nSupport groups also play a vital role in fostering. They connect you with other foster parents who share similar experiences. This camaraderie can provide encouragement, practical advice, and a sense of belonging. Various online forums and community organizations offer a space for foster parents to interact, share resources, and discuss their challenges.\n\nMedical and mental health resources are crucial too. Children entering foster care often need medical attention, as they may have experienced neglect or abuse. Having access to healthcare providers experienced in working with foster children can alleviate concerns about their well-being. This varies from routine medical check-ups to addressing more complex psychological needs. Therapists specializing in trauma-informed care can also be crucial in assisting children on their healing journey.\n\nEducation resources are another pillar of support for children in foster care. Many agencies work closely with schools to ensure that children receive the educational support they need. This can include Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) for children with special needs. Additionally, tutors, mentoring programs, and extra-curricular activities can help bridge any academic gaps and promote confidence and social skills among foster kids.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \nMoreover, financial assistance can relieve some of the burdens associated with fostering. Some states provide stipends to help cover the costs of caring for a foster child. Familiarizing yourself with local and national resources can help you access the grants or benefits available to you as a foster parent. Always remember that you are not alone; various organizations exist to provide guidance in navigating financial support options.\n\nAnother essential element is training for the biological families. In many cases, the ultimate goal of foster care is family reunification. Support and resources offered to the biological parents help them address the issues that led to their child being placed in the system. Programs that assist with parenting skills, substance abuse treatment, and counseling can contribute to successful reunifications, ensuring the child’s safety and well-being.\n\nAdvocacy plays a critical role in improving foster care systems. Engaging with local and national organizations can help raise awareness about the challenges foster children face. Support groups, legislative advocacy, and public awareness campaigns can foster a more informed and compassionate community. Finding ways to advocate for change can empower you and your network while creating a more supportive environment for everyone involved in foster care.\n\nWhile the journey can be challenging, knowing you have a solid support system and access to vital resources can make all the difference. It’s important to leverage these tools to navigate the often tumultuous waters of foster care. With the right support and resources, both foster parents and children can thrive, overcoming obstacles together.\n\nThe Long-Term Effects of Fostering on Children: Outcomes and Successes\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFostering can significantly impact a child's life, creating a variety of long-term effects that shape their future. Children placed in foster care benefit from stable environments which can contribute to their emotional well-being and personal development. Understanding these outcomes can be crucial for prospective foster parents and for society as a whole.\n\nOne of the primary positive outcomes of fostering is improved emotional health and stability. Many children enter the foster system due to instability in their lives, such as neglect or abuse. A loving and supportive foster home can provide safety and stability that these children desperately need. Research shows that children who experience a supportive foster environment often develop better coping mechanisms and lower rates of anxiety and depression compared to their peers who remain in neglectful or abusive situations.\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \nAdditionally, fostering can lead to enhanced educational outcomes. A stable foster home can create an environment where a child can focus on their studies rather than worry about their safety or their next move. Foster parents often take an active role in their children's education by providing tutoring, helping with homework, and encouraging participation in extracurricular activities. This involvement can lead to improved academic performance and increased chances of pursuing higher education.\n\nSocial skills are another area where fostering has profound impacts. Many foster children struggle with feelings of isolation and low self-worth due to their past experiences. In a nurturing foster environment, they can learn how to build healthy relationships, communicate effectively, and develop trust. This growth in social skills is vital, as these children often need to rely on community relationships later in life. Ultimately, fostering can help children cultivate lasting friendships, leading to better social integration.\n\nHowever, fostering also comes with challenges that can result in adverse long-term effects. One of the more concerning issues is the potential for attachment difficulties. Children in foster care may have experienced various placements, leading them to struggle with forming healthy attachments. This can result in issues later in life, such as fear of intimacy and difficulty in trusting others. It's essential for foster parents to understand the importance of consistency and patience in addressing these emotional difficulties.\n\nAnother potential downside is the impact on the child’s identity. Many foster children grapple with feelings of abandonment or loss of their biological families. They may face challenges in understanding their cultural or familial roots. Without proper support, the struggle with identity can continue into adulthood, complicating their sense of self. It's critical for foster parents to help children explore their backgrounds, validate their feelings, and foster a sense of belonging.\n\nHere is a list outlining the major long-term outcomes associated with fostering:\n\n-Could You Be A Foster Carer? Read More - https://fostercareagencies.co.uk/is-fostering-for-you  \n  \n- **Positive Emotional Development:** Increased resilience and lower rates of mental health issues.\n- **Educational Success:** Improved academic performance and higher likelihood of pursuing secondary education.\n- **Enhanced Social Skills:** Building healthy relationships and improving communication abilities.\n- **Attachment Issues:** Difficulty forming bonds due to past experiences.\n- **Identity Struggles:** Challenges related to understanding personal history and cultural identity.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, fostering can create beneficial bonds that promote positive interaction. Foster parents often become role models, providing guidance and support that children might not otherwise receive. These nurturing relationships can last beyond the fostering period, leading to lifelong connections. However, it's also essential to prepare for the emotional toll this can take on both the child and the foster parent when reunification with the biological family occurs or when a child transitions out of the foster system.\n\nFostering is a complex process with both significant benefits and challenges. Understanding these long-term effects helps create a more supportive environment for children in foster care. By being aware of the potential emotional, educational, and social outcomes, you can make informed decisions that not only foster the well-being of children but also positively impact broader societal frameworks that support these young individuals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFostering offers a profound opportunity to impact the lives of both children and families. By understanding the pros and cons of fostering, individuals can better appreciate how their decision affects vulnerable children who need temporary care and support. Personal stories and testimonials shared by foster parents highlight the transformative power of this experience, showing how, despite the challenges, fostering can lead to meaningful relationships and personal growth.\n\nHowever, potential foster parents must weigh the key considerations before taking the leap. The commitment involved requires not only emotional resilience but also an understanding of the legal and procedural landscape of foster care. Navigating the challenges is crucial, but with the right support systems and resources in place, foster parents can thrive and create a nurturing environment for children in need.\n\nThe long-term effects of fostering are significant, influencing the emotional and social development of children. Many foster youths go on to lead fulfilling lives, demonstrating that with the right care and encouragement, they can overcome their early traumas. As you think about fostering, remember that your role extends beyond just providing shelter; you can help shape a brighter future for a child. Ultimately, the decision to foster is one filled with possibilities and challenges, and it’s an experience that has the potential to change lives on all sides. Embrace the journey with an open heart, and you could find that fostering not only transforms the lives of children but enriches your own.",

    "text": "Flock cameras in Eugene and Springfield, Oregon — the pros and cons\nAutomated license-plate readers made by Flock Safety have been a flashpoint across Oregon this year. Eugene, Springfield and Lane County have all signed contracts or installed Flock cameras; community meetings, lawsuits and temporary pauses followed fast as privacy advocates, elected officials and police debated whether the devices are an effective public-safety tool or an unacceptable mass-surveillance step. Below I lay out the main pros and cons for Eugene and Springfield specifically, with local context and practical takeaways. [AP News+3KLCC+3KVAL+3](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nFlock cameras are usually mounted roadside and record vehicle images and license plates. The system indexes plate reads and stores associated photos; law enforcement can query the database for plates, time ranges, or (in some contracts) vehicle descriptions. Proponents say that quick plate-matching helps solve vehicle-related crimes and recover stolen property; opponents worry about long-term tracking, data-sharing and transparency. [KLCC+1](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\n# The Pros\n\n# 1. Faster leads for vehicle-related crimes\n\nPolice and district attorneys repeatedly point to cases where license-plate reader (LPR) hits generated rapid investigative leads — for example, identifying cars seen near a burglary or hit-and-run. Municipalities purchasing Flock gear commonly cite retail theft and organized retail crime as use cases. In Lane County’s documents, reducing vehicle-enabled crimes and giving deputies searchable records was a primary rationale for the contract. [KLCC](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 2. Low manpower, continuous coverage\n\nCompared with assigning officers to stakeouts or manual plate checks, the cameras run 24/7 and can cover high-traffic corridors continuously. For under-staffed police departments this can feel like a force multiplier — especially for crimes that rely on vehicles to move stolen goods. [Lookout Eugene-Springfield](https://lookouteugene-springfield.com/story/justice/2025/09/26/flock-license-plate-reader-cameras-being-installed-in-springfield/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 3. Potential deterrence and recovery rates\n\nWhere LPR networks are dense, some studies and police reports show improved recovery of stolen vehicles and faster identification of suspects who use cars to flee scenes. Vendors and agencies often point to those successes in contracts and press releases. (Note: success rates depend heavily on placement, density and policy controls.) [KLCC](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\n# The Cons\n\n# 1. Privacy and civil-liberties concerns\n\nA core objection is that cameras record *every* vehicle that passes — creating a detailed movement log of residents, visitors, medical travelers and more. Privacy groups (including the ACLU of Oregon locally) argue that this kind of mass capture threatens free-movement, chills speech, and could be used to target vulnerable populations. In Eugene the ACLU and community groups have sued the city for records about camera locations and policies. That legal fight highlights how much trust and transparency matter when surveillance tech is introduced. [ACLU of Oregon+1](https://www.aclu-or.org/press-releases/aclu-of-oregon-and-partners-sue-city-of-eugene-for-failing-to-disclose-public-records-on-flock-cameras/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 2. Data-sharing risks and federal access worries\n\nRecent national headlines show that questions about who can query LPR data are real and evolving. Flock paused some federal pilot programs after concerns about access and compliance surfaced; federal agency access to regional plate data has prompted scrutiny in other states. That history raises legitimate worries about whether local data could be queried by out-of-jurisdiction or federal bodies for purposes the community did not intend. [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/cc5f29df94a29ee2c6c2feb2151c8f5e?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 3. Lack of transparency and community buy-in\n\nIn Eugene and Springfield much of the dispute has centered on process: records, location disclosure, contract terms and whether installations occurred before public dialogue finished. When citizens feel excluded — or when locations are undisclosed — trust collapses quickly and political backlash (including lawsuits and council pauses) follows. Several communities have installed cameras then deactivated them pending policy discussions. [KVAL+1](https://kval.com/news/local/springfield-follows-eugenes-lead-putting-pause-on-flock-cameras-lane-county-oregon-license-plate-reader?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 4. Mission-creep and technical vulnerabilities\n\nCritics point to the potential for mission-creep (adding facial recognition, more extensive retention, or broader vehicle-analytics) or security flaws that could expose sensitive logs. Opponents also highlight that vendor practices and corporate decisions can affect how data is used; some local editorials argue Flock’s corporate behavior and policy history make it an untrustworthy partner. Those concerns factor into whether a public agency should rely on a private company to host or manage sensitive data. [Lookout Eugene-Springfield+1](https://lookouteugene-springfield.com/story/community-voices/2025/11/22/flock-safety-a-fundamentally-untrustworthy-partner/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# 5. Vandalism, community friction, and costs\n\nInstalling visible cameras can provoke vandalism and protest, which some local outlets have already reported. There are also recurring costs for hardware, software subscriptions, and legal/administrative oversight — expenses that must be weighed against other public-safety investments. [KVAL](https://kval.com/news/local/eugene-police-release-flock-camera-locations-following-city-councils-decision-to-pause-automated-license-plate-reader-community-concerns-privacy?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\n# Eugene &amp; Springfield: Where things stand (as of recent local coverage)\n\n* Springfield installed roughly 25 cameras to meet a grant timeline but paused activation for broader community discussion; calibration and limited testing occurred before the pause. [Lookout Eugene-Springfield+1](https://lookouteugene-springfield.com/story/springfield/2025/10/20/what-we-know-about-the-flock-license-plate-reader-cameras-in-springfield/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Lane County signed a multi-year contract with Flock and the sheriff’s office has acquired cameras awaiting deployment plans. Eugene faced criticism for not disclosing all camera locations and was sued by the ACLU seeking records; cities have at times deactivated cameras pending council or legal processes. These developments show a patchwork of contracts, community responses and legal challenges across the region. [KLCC+2ACLU of Oregon+2](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\n# Practical recommendations for local leaders and residents\n\n* **Transparency first:** publish maps of camera locations, retention schedules, and exact policies for queries and third-party access. Openness reduces litigation risk and builds trust. [Register-Guard](https://www.registerguard.com/story/news/courts/2025/10/21/oregon-aclu-sues-eugene-flock-cameras/86821396007/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Narrow use policies:** limit retention times, forbid bulk tracking queries, and ban searches for constitutionally protected activities (political, reproductive–health–related, etc.). Enshrine oversight and audit rights. [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/cc5f29df94a29ee2c6c2feb2151c8f5e?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Community oversight:** create a civilian oversight board or independent auditor to review use and handle complaints. Public input should precede activation. [KVAL](https://kval.com/news/local/springfield-follows-eugenes-lead-putting-pause-on-flock-cameras-lane-county-oregon-license-plate-reader?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Cost/benefit audits:** require departments to report before/after metrics showing whether the cameras actually reduced crime or improved case clearance rates relative to other policing investments. [KLCC](https://www.klcc.org/crime-law-justice/2025-10-27/lane-county-has-a-contract-with-ai-license-plate-company-flock-but-says-it-hasnt-installed-any-cameras-yet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n\n\n# Bottom line\n\nFlock cameras are a powerful, targeted tool for vehicle-centric investigations — but they bring significant privacy risks, governance challenges and public-trust hazards. In Eugene and Springfield those tradeoffs are playing out in real time: councils are pausing activations, community groups are suing for records, and public debate is shaping policy. If local governments proceed, doing so with full disclosure, tight usage limits, independent oversight, and clear metrics will be essential to balancing safety goals with civil-liberties protections.

    "text": "Solar A1.6 TBOP Review\nThis is my new Solar A1.6 TBOP guitar, my first Solar as well as the first guitar I’ve used or owned with an Evertune bridge. \n\nFor the TLDR-minded, here are the main takeaways:\n\nTHE GOOD\n - Excellent finish and fretwork\n - Neck and neck joint are perfect (for me)\n - Evertune bridge works as advertised \n - Ridiculously fast shipping and arrival time \n - Value for price paid \n - The look is METAL incarnate 🤘🏽\n\nTHE “JUST OKAY”\n - Pickups do their job but aren’t “special”\n - No gig bag included (Even Standberg includes a gig bag)\n - Volume and tone pots have more turning resistance than I’m used to \n\nTHE BAD\n - Nothing (so far)\n\nThe long version:\n\nSo let’s start the diatribe off with facts: I’m in my mid 50s. My musical journey since picking up the guitar in high school includes a ton of metal, rock, thrash, punk, classical, and jazz influences. For more context, over the decades, I’ve owned/own Fender, Epiphone, Yamaha, Cort, Ibanez, Sterling, Strandberg, Schecter, ESP, Easton, Godin, and various luthier makes of acoustic Selmer style “Gypsy jazz” guitars. \n\nGiven all of that, this Solar guitar manages to stand out in my house of instruments, both past and present. \n\nFirst off, the fit and finish is beyond my expectations. The fret edges are smooth. The paint and clearcoat are even. It “feels” more expensive than what I paid for it. I don’t know exactly why I was expecting lesser quality than what I got. Maybe it’s because of the price point, or because it was made in a factory that simultaneously produces a ton of other popular brands. Regardless, the Solar guitar feels like a higher end product.\n\nI chose a guitar with an Evertune bridge because I wanted a reliable and convenient instrument for recording. It took a little bit of time to set up, but the Evertune bridge works as advertised. Yes, I can bend notes, but the guitar’s bridge doesn’t come set up for that. I had to set it up to bend notes like I’m used to doing. But if you read the included instructions, it’s not too difficult to get the bridge set up however you want. For comparison, it’s no more difficult to set up an Evertune bridge than it is to set up a floating Floyd Rose or Gotoh bridge, IMO. \n\nThe rest is all pretty good. Access to the upper frets is amazing. It’s even better than on my similarly designed Shechter guitar and it’s relatively light compared to my other solid body electric guitars. The matte finish on the neck works as advertised. It’s smooth, and it feels as good as it looks. \n\nOverall, the sound is good, but not surprising. The pick ups aren’t that hot, but that doesn’t mean they don’t do the job. They sound as expected when chugging away at high gain settings and are capable when it comes to shredding. That said, the Duncan Solar passive pick ups don’t have the same definition when compared to my active pick up guitars. Does the Solar sound “bad”? Nope. It delivers. In fact, I prefer the clean sounds that I get from the Solar compared to my other solid bodies.\n\nOther than a volume and tone pot with more resistance than I’m used to, and my possibly misplaced expectation that I had for this guitar coming with an included gig bag, I’m very satisfied with my purchase. \n\nAnd considering that I ordered on a Tuesday and it arrived on Friday, that’s faster than I’ve received guitars from Sweetwater. It’s even more impressive when you take into account that it shipped from Spain and I’m in Los Angeles. \n\nAs for the overall value, I’d say it’s a better value when compared to other dual passive humbucker solid body electrics. Going by what’s available on Sweetwater, a similarly spec’d Asian made guitar is anywhere from ~$1,600 and up. My guitar was on sale for $899, and with the added shipping ($39) and tariff fees($269.61!!! Yeah, for real.), it came out to $1,208.51. That’s still less than comparable guitars. \n\nIf you’re looking for a metal guitar at a more than reasonable price point, then lucky you, you have a lot of choices. Whichever way you choose, I highly recommend you do the research. My research led me to this Solar A1.6 and I am not disappointed.\n\nAlso, it happens to look great with my other guitars on the wall. Win win.",

    "text": "'Wicked: For Good' - Review Thread\n*Now demonized as the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba lives in exile in the Ozian forest, while Glinda resides at the palace in Emerald City, reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. As an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, she'll need to reunite with Glinda to transform herself, and all of Oz, for good.*\n\nDirector: John M. Chu\n\nCast: Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, , Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Marissa Bode, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Yeoh, Colman Domingo, Peter Dinklage, Bowen Yang\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [72%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wicked_for_good)\n\n**Metacritic:** [61 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wicked-for-good/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[Next Best Picture - Lauren LaMagna](https://nextbestpicture.com/wicked-for-good/) \\- 7 / 10\n\n&gt;The cast, led by the phenomenal Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, still deliver fantastic work that is supported by excellent crafts from all departments of production. But the source material is inherently weaker than the first, making this a less fulfilling entry as a standalone, even if it compliments Part One as a whole. The additional scenes are not necessary and only exist for the material to be long enough to qualify its own feature film, which also results in pacing issues.\n\n[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20251118-wicked-for-good-review) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;Let's be clear: the Wicked films are the definition of preaching to the choir. They aren't likely to win over anyone sceptical of candy-coloured spectacle and overt sentimentality presented in Broadway show-stopping fashion. Wicked is what it is. But if you're fine with that, this latest instalment is more captivating than the last and enjoyable to watch throughout.\n\n[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/11/wicked-for-good-review-jon-chus-part-2-musical-adaptation-1236620980/)\n\n&gt;What can we say about the performances that hasn’t already been said? Both Erivo and Grande could not be better, and in fact Grande really gets a chance to shine here and runs away with the picture whenever she is on screen. Erivo’s Elphaba remains the juiciest role and she defines it with the mortality only movies can bring. Bailey is terrific again, and Goldblum’s Wizard really comes into deep focus now and he’s got it going on. Marissa Bode’s wheelchair-bound Nessarose is given some key screen time and delivers in a piece of casting that is as inspiring as the character she plays. Nathan Crowley outdoes his Oscar winning production design this time around, as does Paul Tazewell’s Oscared Costumes. The visual effects are first rate. So is this whole splendidly realized and cinematic musical adaptation which if you add up the running times of both films comes in just two minutes shy of 5(!) hours. To be honest I wanted *more.*\n\n[The Telegraph - Robbie Collin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2025/11/18/wicked-for-good-review-second-part-fails-to-take-flight/) \\- 1 / 5\n\n&gt;Ariana Grande is painfully wooden in Wicked’s irritating sequel. What makes it so frustrating is that director Jon M Chu is an established musicals master; his In the Heights is a modern classic of the form. But the corporate stretch-it-out-and-wring-it-dry approach here has been deadening. Even the staunchest defenders of Wicked, the stage musical about the tragic origins of The Wizard of Oz’s Witch of the West, would have to concede that it peaks just before the interval...\n\n[Slant Magazine - Dan Rubins](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jonathan-bailey/) \\- 2.5 / 5\n\n&gt;But for as sharp as it may sometimes be, *For Good* is stretched out, breathless, and never really emotionally affecting, even on the level of nostalgia. (However bloated, the first film, to quote one of Glinda’s malapropisms, is thrillifying.) It may transport audiences, especially younger ones, to the colorful Oz for the bulk of an afternoon, but it also serves as a reminder that only in its tauter, wrenching stage form can *Wicked*, like a handprint on your heart, really leave you changed for good.\n\n[Loud and Clear - Joseph Tomastik](https://loudandclearreviews.com/wicked-for-good-film-review/)\n\n&gt;*Wicked: For Good* takes many huge swings but misses in baffling fashion, making for a technically impressive but disappointing conclusion to the *Wicked* story. By all accounts, this is the much more difficult half of the story to pull off, as it’s where the musical in particular gets much denser and incorporates many more direct elements from *The Wizard of Oz*. Unfortunately, that difficulty rears its ugly head in *Wicked: For Good*. As ambitious as this movie is for tackling already-unwieldy source material, those ambitions ultimately don’t pay off.\n\n[RogerEbert - Christy Lemire](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wicked-2-for-good-film-review-2025) \\- 3 / 4\n\n&gt;If it sounds like this second half is darker than the first, it is, but it’s also more effective in its consistency of tone. “Wicked” was all fun and games until it wasn’t, and that sudden shift was jarring. In “For Good,” we know from the start that we’re in more serious territory with the deep strings of John Powell’s score as Ozian workers build the Yellow Brick Road. Erivo and Grande find just the right amount of tenderness and sadness with “For Good,” and that bond between them shines bright once more. Poignant and intimate, it’s a legitimate tearjerker. Bring tissues. \n\n[AwardsWatch - Sophia Ciminello](https://awardswatch.com/wicked-for-good-review-jon-m-chu-fails-to-cast-a-spell-with-bloated-fan-service-filled-finale-c/) \\- 'C-'\n\n&gt;Despite stellar work from Erivo and Grande, *Wicked: For Good* can’t justify its existence as its own separate outing. Even with a pair of new songs and a deeper exploration of some of the musical’s beloved characters, the runtime feels bloated and bogged down by Chu’s constant attempts to make this a movie of the moment and to remind audiences of the connection they had to the first film. Simply put, Chu does not add enough new material to make this film feel like much more than a studio cash grab. There’s certainly still magic to be found in the movie for those who are seeking it, but when the credits finally roll, it’s difficult to say that Chu’s additions to this film have changed the world of *Wicked* for the better.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/18/wicked-for-good-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-jeff-goldblum) \\- 4 / 5\n\n&gt;It’s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard’s final benediction. But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful.\n\n[FilmHounds - Paul Klein](https://filmhounds.co.uk/2025/11/wicked-for-good-film-review/)\n\n&gt;Erivo, Grande and Bailey are all fantastic once again, and allowed to deepen the characters more and show the complexities of them, while also remaining true to why people love them so much. It's a shame that the rest of the cast are given short shrift. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode have the rumblings of a more interesting subplot that doesn't really go anywhere as much as it should. Even so, and despite its more frantic nature, *Wicked: For Good* continues to lovingly taking a look at what it means to be a rebel against dictatorships, how people will lie to you to get what they want, and how you must remain true to yourself at all times. It's not so much that the film is disappointing, that would be too harsh a criticism. It's that the film is merely as good as it could be, given what the stage show offers. It wraps things up, but there's no feeling of cohesion – something that was never going to be in Chu's hands, and for what he has, he excels at.\n\n[Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wicked-for-good-review-sequel-b2866672.html) \\- 2 / 5\n\n&gt;For Good has little sense of movement, literally or emotionally – no profound revelations, no wonder or spectacle. All that’s to be done now is for each character to process, via standardised ballad, what they’ve learned.",

Others wanted to know which Reddit\nthreads were [influencing Claude's answers](https://blog.stateshift.com/why-\nyour-content-isnt-showing-up-in-ai-and-how-to-fix-it/). Google Search Console\ncouldn't help. Ahrefs didn't have the data. We were guessing.\n\nWe tried Otterly first. It was helpful for monitoring, good for alerts and\nseeing when a brand appeared in AI answers. But when a client asked, \"Which\nDevRel topics should we focus on next?\" Otterly couldn't help us explore the\nlandscape. We needed something closer to how we use Ahrefs: the ability to\ntest ideas, compare prompts, check competitors, and see the patterns behind\nthe results.\n\nThen I came across a [YouTube video from Exposure\nNinja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPjKv5wxxnw) where he reviewed Peec AI.\nWithin a few minutes, I could tell it was built for research, not just\ntracking. Peec showed the actual Reddit threads shaping answers, the YouTubers\nwho kept showing up for our target prompts, and the blogs engines trusted\nmost. It gave me a clearer sense of where people were talking, who had\ninfluence, and where we could add something meaningful instead of guessing.\n\nI signed Stateshift up for an account and started testing it for our own use.\n\nWithin a month, I'd recommended it to three clients. All three signed up for\ntheir own accounts. Because Peec has unlimited seats, they added me to their\ndashboards, which gave me an easy way to switch between our account and\ntheirs. Same interface, different data, no extra logins.\n\nThree months later, it's part of our weekly workflow across multiple\ncompanies.\n\nThis Peec AI review is a summary of what we've learned: what it's good at,\nwhere it still needs work, and how it fits into a space that's changing\nquickly.\n\n## How We Use Peec AI (and Why It's Helpful)\n\nWe help developer-focused companies understand how people discover them. SEO\nis part of that. Content is part of that. Community and ecosystem work are\npart of that.\n\nAI search visibility is now part of that too.\n\nWe use Peec primarily for:\n\nUnderstanding where a brand shows up in AI-generated answers\n\nIdentifying topics worth investing in before writing anything\n\nThe value isn't in the charts. It's in being able to see the conversations and\nsources that shape AI responses. That's the part we could never see before.\n\n## Peec's Most Useful Features (Based on Actual Use)\n\nThese aren't marketing claims. These are features we used regularly over the\nlast three months.\n\n### Dashboard\n\n![Peec AI Review of dashboard](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-11.42.28-AM-1024x619.png)\n\nOnce you add your site, competitors, and prompts, the dashboard becomes a good\nplace to check in. It's simple enough that you can tell what's happening in\nunder a minute.\n\nHere's what we pay attention to:\n\n**Visibility**  \nA quick read on how often a brand shows up compared to competitors.\n\n**Industry ranking**  \nA clean table showing each domain's average position, sentiment, and\nvisibility over the last seven days.\n\n**Recent mentions**  \nUseful when a prompt moves unexpectedly. If a client suddenly appears for\nsomething new, we can click in and see why.\n\n**Sources**  \nA snapshot of where AI engines are pulling from. Reddit threads, docs, blog\nposts, competitor content, and so on.\n\nIt's designed for quick check-ins, not constant monitoring.\n\n### Prompts\n\n**[Insert screenshot - Alt text: Peec AI prompt tracking interface with\nsuggested prompts and volume indicators]**\n\n![Peec AI review of prompt screen](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-11.25.55-AM-1024x725.png)**Tesla\nprompts shown here. Our real prompts are staying in the vault.**\n\nThis is where most of our work happens.\n\nPeec lets you manually add the prompts you care about. We usually start with\nquestions we hear directly from buyers and internal teams:\n\n  * \"DevRel ROI metrics\"\n  * \"Developer community engagement strategy\"\n  * \"Best developer onboarding approaches\"\n  * \"Companies that help build developer ecosystems\"\n\nThe part that's been most helpful is the Suggested Prompts tab. Peec scans\nyour site and generates queries that might matter. We don't accept all of\nthem, but a few have led us to test angles we would've missed.\n\nThe timeline feature is straightforward. You can view 7-, 14-, or 30-day\nwindows (or set a custom range), but only for as long as you've been using the\ntool. If you've only tracked prompts for two weeks, that's all the history you\nhave. Fair enough. Just start early.\n\nBecause Peec has unlimited seats, clients can add me into their workspaces.\nThat makes it easy to refine prompt lists together instead of trading\nscreenshots.\n\nWe also use prompts for short-term research. If a client is exploring a new\ncategory or deciding between topics, we'll add 10 to 20 prompts, track them\nfor a few days, see what the engines cite, and make a call. It's faster than\ntraditional SEO research because generative engines shift quickly.\n\n### Sources\n\nThis has become one of the most useful parts of Peec for tracking AI mentions.\nInstead of guessing why a brand appears in an AI answer, you can see the\ndomains and URLs that influenced it.\n\nThere are two main views:\n\n**Domains**\n\n![Peec AI review of domains view with competitor analysis and citation\nfrequency\\]](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-11.35.00-AM-1024x668.png)\nPeec AI's Domain View of Sources\n\nThis shows:\n\n  * the type of domain (competitor, your brand, UGC, editorial, docs, etc.)\n  * how often each domain appears in chat responses\n  * average citations used over the last seven days\n\nIt gives a broad sense of where engines are pulling from.\n\n**URLs**\n\n**[Insert screenshot - Alt text: Peec AI sources tab displaying URL-level\ncitations and sentiment analysis]**\n\n![Peec AI review of URL view of sources](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-11.34.44-AM-1-1024x662.png)Peec\nAI's URL View of Sources\n\nThis is the view we use the most.\n\nIt shows:\n\n  * the exact URLs being cited\n  * whether the mention was positive or neutral\n  * whether the content is yours, a competitor's, or a third party\n  * the last time that URL influenced an answer\n\nThis has helped us:\n\n  * catch older posts that still perform well\n  * spot content gaps\n  * see which competitor docs engines lean on\n  * understand when a Reddit thread is shaping results\n  * identify pages worth updating rather than rewriting\n\nThe table gives everything we need.\n\n### How It Helps With Client Work\n\nSince Peec allows unlimited seats, the three clients who signed up added me to\ntheir accounts. That means I can switch between Stateshift's dashboard and\neach client's dashboard without separate logins. Same tool, different data.\n\nWe use it to:\n\n  * review prompt visibility\n  * understand competitive movement\n  * audit the sources shaping AI responses\n  * evaluate new content ideas\n  * catch early shifts in topics\n  * correct assumptions that don't match the data\n\nIt has become a useful way to align strategy quickly without long research\ncycles.\n\n## A Quick Note on Peec AI's Recent Funding\n\nRight after we wrapped our testing, Peec announced a $21M Series A led by\nSingular, which appears to be the largest raise in the AI search visibility\ncategory so far. They also mentioned they're now working with over 1,300\nbrands.\n\nThe takeaway isn't the money. It's what they said they're focusing on next:\nfaster updates, cleaner data, deeper insights, and an expansion into a broader\nmarketing stack for AI search.\n\nBased on what we've seen so far, more investment in data quality and research\nfeatures would be helpful, so it's good to see that direction.\n\n**[Insert screenshot - Alt text: Peec AI funding announcement banner showing\n$21M Series A]**\n\n## Peec AI Pricing (Converted to USD)\n\n![Peec AI review of current pricing \\(2025\\)](https://blog.stateshift.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/11/Peec-AI-Pricing-1024x577.jpg)\n\nPeec lists pricing in euros, so here's the equivalent in dollars:\n\n**Starter: ~$97/mo**\n\n  * 25 prompts\n  * ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, AIO\n  * roughly 2,250 AI answers analyzed each month\n\n**Pro: ~$217/mo**\n\n  * 100 prompts\n  * All major models\n  * around 9,000 answers analyzed\n\n**Enterprise: ~$545+/mo**\n\n  * 300+ prompts\n  * Custom reporting\n  * 27,000+ answers analyzed\n\nPricing is credit-based. Costs go up as you add more prompts or platforms, so\nit's worth deciding which engines matter most for your audience.\n\n## Where Peec AI Is Strong\n\n  * Designed for exploration, not just monitoring\n  * Easy to work with across multiple client accounts\n  * Suggested Prompts reduces guesswork\n  * URL-level visibility helps explain \"why\" results appear\n  * Clean interface\n  * Unlimited seats (surprisingly helpful)\n  * Fast enough for real research cycles\n\n## Where It Still Needs Work\n\n  * More transparency around how visibility percentages are calculated\n  * Multi-platform tracking can get expensive\n  * Some graphs require hovering to see details clearly\n  * Historical data only goes back to when you started tracking\n  * A user community or forum would be helpful\n\nNone of these are deal-breakers, but they're areas where improvement would\nmake Peec more useful, especially as AI search evolves.\n\n## How Peec AI Compares to Other AI Visibility Tools\n\n### Peec AI vs Otterly\n\nWe used Otterly before switching to Peec. Otterly is better for alerts and\nmonitoring. If you just need to know when your brand is mentioned, it works\nwell. Peec is better for research: prompt suggestions, volume indicators, and\nthe ability to test ideas quickly. If you're doing content planning, Peec is\nmore useful.\n\n### Peec AI vs Ahrefs/SEMrush\n\nTraditional SEO tools don't track AI search visibility. Ahrefs and SEMrush\nshow you what ranks in Google. Peec shows you what appears in ChatGPT, Claude,\nand Perplexity. They serve different purposes. We use both.\n\n### Peec AI vs Other AI Visibility Trackers\n\nPeec's main advantages: unlimited seats, suggested prompts, and URL-level\ninsights. It's not the cheapest option, but the research features are stronger\nthan most alternatives we've tested. If you need basic monitoring, there are\ncheaper tools. If you need to understand competitive gaps and explore new\ntopics, Peec is worth the difference.\n\n### Peec vs Otterly vs Ahrefs: Quick Comparison\n\nFeature | Peec AI | Otterly | Ahrefs/SEMrush  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Tracks AI Search Visibility** |  ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No  \n**Tracks Google SEO** |  ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes  \n**Suggested Prompts** |  ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No  \n**URL-Level Citation Data** |  ✅ Yes | Limited | ❌ No  \n**Unlimited Team Seats** |  ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No  \n**Best For** |  Research &amp; exploration | Monitoring &amp; alerts | Google SEO  \n**Starting Price** |  ~$97/mo | ~$99/mo | ~$129/mo  \n**Platforms Tracked** |  ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, more | ChatGPT,\nPerplexity, Gemini | Google only  \n  \n## Who Peec AI Is a Good Fit For\n\nPeec is most helpful if:\n\n  * your audience uses AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to research products\n  * you want to make content decisions based on real data\n  * you need to understand what engines cite and why\n  * you work with multiple stakeholders and need a single shared view\n  * you want something closer to \"Ahrefs for AI search\"\n\nIt's less useful if you're not actively creating content or if AI search isn't\na meaningful part of your buyer journey yet.\n\n## Should You Use Peec AI? Quick Decision Guide\n\nYour Situation | Use Peec? | Why  \n---|---|---  \nYour buyers use ChatGPT/Claude to research products | ✅ Yes | You need to know\nwhere you appear in AI answers  \nYou're actively creating content | ✅ Yes | Peec helps prioritize topics worth\nwriting about  \nYou need to understand competitive gaps | ✅ Yes | Shows exactly where\ncompetitors appear and you don't  \nYou work with a distributed team | ✅ Yes | Unlimited seats make collaboration\neasy  \nYou just need basic monitoring | ⚠️ Maybe | Consider cheaper alternatives like\nOtterly  \nYour buyers don't use AI search yet | ❌ Not yet | Wait until AI search becomes\nrelevant  \nYou're not creating content regularly | ❌ Not yet | Limited value without\ncontent strategy  \nYou only care about Google SEO | ❌ No | Use Ahrefs or SEMrush instead  \n  \n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### **Is Peec AI worth the price?**\n\nFor teams where AI search visibility matters (developer tools, SaaS platforms,\ntechnical products), Peec is worth it. The unlimited seats, prompt\nsuggestions, and URL-level insights make it more useful than monitoring-only\ntools. If your buyers aren't using ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to research\nproducts yet, wait.\n\n### **How does Peec AI compare to Otterly?**\n\nOtterly is better for monitoring and alerts. Peec is better for research and\nexploration. If you need to understand _why_ brands appear in AI answers and\nwhich topics are worth investing in, Peec has stronger research features.\nOtterly is solid if you just need to track mentions.\n\n### **Does Peec AI track all AI platforms?**\n\nStarter and Pro plans include ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI\nOverviews. Additional platforms (Claude, DeepSeek, etc.) cost extra. Check\nwhich platforms your audience actually uses before paying for everything.\n\n### **Can multiple team members use Peec AI?**\n\nYes. All Peec plans include unlimited seats at no extra cost. This is one of\nits biggest advantages. Your whole team can access the same data without per-\nuser fees.\n\n### **How long does it take to see results in Peec AI?**\n\nPeec starts tracking prompts immediately, but you'll only see trends after 7\nto 14 days. The tool doesn't provide historical data from before you started\ntracking, so sign up early if you're planning to use it.\n\n### **What 's the difference between Peec's Starter and Pro plans?**\n\nStarter gives you 25 prompts for ~$97/month. Pro gives you 100 prompts for\n~$217/month. If you're testing multiple content angles or working with several\nproduct lines, you'll outgrow 25 prompts quickly. Most teams doing serious\nresearch need Pro.\n\n## Peec AI Review: Final Thoughts\n\nPeec isn't a magic traffic button. What it gives you is visibility into a part\nof the research process that used to be completely opaque. For teams working\nin developer-focused or technical categories, that clarity makes planning much\neasier.\n\nWe use Peec to understand where clients show up, why they show up, and which\ntopics are worth investing in next. The research features are strong, the\nworkflow is simple, and the unlimited seats make collaboration easy.\n\nThe AI search visibility tool category is still new, and Peec has room to\ngrow. But after three months of using it across several companies, it's the\ntool we've chosen to keep using.\n\nFor developer-focused companies working with Stateshift, Peec has become part\nof our standard toolkit alongside SEO research and content strategy. It\nanswers questions we couldn't answer before.\n\nIf AI search visibility matters in your space, Peec is worth trying.\n\nCheers, Jono",

This works for about 24 hours before they vanish again, which points directly to a re-indexing glitch.\n\n**This is a list of sellers from THIS THREAD ALONE who have confirmed this specific issue or a catastrophic, unprecedented drop since Nov 6th:**\n\n* u/hakancba (shared a **screenshot** of the traffic collapse)\n* u/WholePrize1325 (went from **20+ sales/day to zero overnight**)\n* u/4163101 (14-year-old shop; had something happen that has **never happened before**)\n* u/halfasshippie3 (sales \"fell off a cliff on November 6\")\n* u/modernheirloom (13-year Star Seller; traffic \"fallen off a cliff\")\n* u/Ok-Physics_4154 (confirmed listings are **\"not even showing in search\"**)\n* u/bunbunpom (confirmed their listings **\"started disappearing from search\"** and the **Vacation Mode fix worked**)\n* u/BennosukeMusashi (\"no traffic, no sales, it stopped totally!\")\n* u/Tiny_Luck_6619 (100k+ sales shop, lost $1000 before understanding what happened)\n* u/Specific-Ad8595 ($15k/month shop that **\"tanked\"** and **\"can't find my shop in search\"**)\n* u/Sensitive_Buffalo230 (Bestseller shop, stats showed **\"just dashes\"** overnight on 11/7)\n* u/No_Variation4267 (went from 10 sales/day to 0, confirmed the **Vacation Mode fix worked in seconds**)\n* u/Ok-Comedian-9377 (went from **\"thousands of dollars a week and went to zero\"**)\n* u/UsualEnvironment9651 (shop was **\"switched off... not searchable\"**)\n* u/Reiki-Raker (8-year shop with **\"Zero sales unless they are repeat customers clicking direct links\"**)\n* u/veganmarshmallows (stats went to **\"0 never had that before\"**)\n* u/Outside_Distance1565 (confirmed sales **\"fell off a cliff\"** and the **\"vacation hack\" works**)\n* u/emmajje (shop was **\"completely deindexed\"** and also confirmed the **vacation mode workaround**)\n* u/Busy-Apple-41 (12-year shop, went from **$15k/month to $206** since Nov 6th, \"completely invisible\")\n* u/WhereasShot9447 (confirmed listings **\"completely disappeared from search\"** on Nov 7th and the **holiday mode fix worked**)\n* u/kohalu (Star Seller, 7,000+ sales; discovered **after seeing this thread** that the majority of their items were delisted)\n* u/ConstantDisplay6533 (confirmed an **\"absolutely identical\"** experience to other sellers, where one Etsy rep was able to \"renew\" their listings and magically restore sales for a day)\n* u/JaylaCrowblade (views collapsed from 200/day to just 10, with only **1 sale since November 7th**. they also confirmed a **95%+ drop in daily favorites)**\n* u/thatladyfromforest (sales \"stopped\" after the 6th, resulting in abnormal zero-sale days. confirmed that after trying the **\"vacation hack,\" they received 4 sales within a few hours.**)\n* u/Fun-Abalone-7303 (**2-year Star Seller** with **2,000+ sales**, views crashed from an average of **1,500-1,600 per day** to a \"huge decline.\", **could not see any of their listings**, **vacation mode fix restored them**, pointing to it being a bug.)\n* u/DuckDuckMoosedUp (since the beginning of Nov, shop went from **\"record sales volume to virtually nothing.\"**)\n* u/Regular-Diamond-8744 (**5 years, 10,000 sales,** traffic and sales down **56% year-over-year** since the 4th/5th of November, after being up 41% YOY until that point.)\n* u/Present-Wear2096 (**36,000 sales,** since November 8th, **\"can't find my products in search.\"**)\n* u/Educational_Sink9178 (new Star Seller shop, views \"abruptly came down\" from 100 daily to 25 on Nov 12, listings **\"disappeared from search results.\"**)\n* u/CombinationFun8692 (**\"sudden drop\",** bestseller **\"didn’t show up in search from Nov 5-8,\"** views collapsing from 300-500 a day to less than 100.)\n* u/thedave89 (after being up 50-100% YOY every month this year, since **early November they are now down 60%.**)\n* u/hjsjsvfgiskla (\"**everything stopped all of a sudden on 6/7th Nov**... absolutely nothing.\" confirmed the Vacation Mode trick produces a \"slight uptick,\" but the listings \"vanish again.\")\n* u/Venerian (views down by 70%, orders down by 93%, and revenue down by 94%; for the past week shop **\"completely dead,\"** with the only recent sales coming from repeat customers, not from organic search).\n* u/Possible-Barnacle-78 (collapse from an average of 10 orders and $700-$1000 in sales per day to \"1 to zero\" orders a day, \"**since a week or so**\", with visits plummeting from 1000 daily to just 70-80. vacation mode worked but then \"stopped again\")\n* u/Immorefunthanyou (**\"downturn around the 6th\"** and a **\"dead stop\"** in sales, something they've never seen before in their long history.

Their income dropped from a consistent £1k per day in November to just £20 in one day. They also confirmed the Vacation Mode workaround re-indexed their shop.\n* **thechamomilecrow** (11+ years on Etsy) reported waking up to find their entire shop with 1,300+ listings \"COMPLETELY MISSING FROM SEARCH\" for the fourth day in a row.

They also confirmed that their listings keep disappearing the next day, requiring them to repeat the Vacation Mode fix.\n* **EclipseEmpress** reported their shop has been completely removed from Etsy search since November 6th. They confirmed the Vacation Mode toggle fixes it for about 24 hours before the shop disappears again.\n* **Dadshats** (a shop with $15,000 revenue last month) reported their shop \"suddenly disappeared from Etsy search\" on November 6th. They confirmed the Vacation Mode trick worked for about 10 hours before everything dropped again.\n* **RuncornWax** reported that after months of great performance, their shop suddenly had zero views, which they knew was a bug. They contacted support, who \"refreshed\" their listings, and views returned within minutes, suggesting an indexing issue.\n* **JosephineBowDesigns** (9 years, 51,000+ sales) reported their views have dropped to nothing and they are \"not appearing in ANY searches,\" despite having a strong month prior. They were given generic \"policy violation\" and \"normal fluctuations\" excuses by support.\n* **CarnivorousThings** (11 years, 10,000+ sales, Star Seller) reported their views and visits went to \"zero.

100, with all listings lost from searches starting November 8th.\n* **HeirloomHandmadeKY** reported being on the first page of results and now cannot find their listings at all, noting that even when

all.\" \n* **FamLoveGifts** confirmed that the \"Vacation mode\" workaround helped them yesterday, but today they \"got unindexed again,\" confirming the recurring nature of the bug.\n* **ArampiShop**

issue\" and have been using the vacation mode fix, proving it's not just affecting established shops.\n* **EmbellishBoots** came to the forums to check after experiencing \"very few views and no sales,\" realizing after reading the thread that it wasn't just them.\n* **VistasPrintCO** reported that for them the issue started yesterday (Nov 12), with \"almost all of my listings gone from search.\" They confirmed that even copy-pasting the full title into search would not work, and their visits dropped from over 400 per day to less than 50.\n* **FureverPetDesign** described an \"extremely unusual drop in traffic,\" something they've \"never experienced\" in all their years on Etsy, especially during peak season.\n* **AllSetFred** reported this has happened to their shop

At the same time, please understand you are almost certainly benefiting from this bug. When a big chunk of your competition is removed from the marketplace, their traffic goes to the shops that are still visible. Your good fortune is actually more proof of how massive and real this disruption is.\n\nThe goal here is to get this platform-breaking bug acknowledged and fixed!\n\n///////\n\n**If you're an Etsy seller, check your stats right now. You might be affected without realizing it.**\n\nSince November 6th, established Etsy shops are being completely removed from search results with zero explanation. This isn't about normal algorithm fluctuations - entire shops with years of history are going from thousands of views to almost **ZERO overnight**.\n\n**The Pattern:**\n\n* Started November 6-7, 2025\n* Shops completely disappear from all search results\n* Visits/Orders from search drop to absolute zero (not just low - ZERO)\n* Affects established shops with perfect metrics, Star Seller status, no violations\n* Vacation Mode toggle temporarily fixes it for \\~24 hours, then it breaks again\n\n**Who's Being Hit:**\n\n* Shops with 5-15+ years of history AND new shops\n* Star Sellers with thousands of sales\n* International and US sellers alike\n* Both POD and handmade shops\n\n**The Real Damage:**\n\n* Sellers going from 30+ sales/day to **ZERO**\n* Peak Q4 season completely destroyed\n* People unable to pay their bills\n* Small businesses built over years vanishing overnight\n\n**Etsy's Response So Far:**\n\n* Generic \"consumer behavior changes\" excuses\n* Support agents giving conflicting information\n* Some agents finally admitted engineers are \"investigating\" with no timeline\n* Others claim there's no issue at all\n* Auto-closing support tickets\n\n**Data Collection - We Need Numbers:** If you're affected, please comment with:\n\n1. When did your traffic die? (specific date)\n2. How long has your shop been active?\n3. Are you Star Seller/Top Seller?\n4. What's your normal daily traffic vs now?\n\n**This is happening during the most important sales period of the year.** For many sellers, this is their main source of income. Mortgage payments, medical bills, holiday expenses - all dependent on shops that Etsy has seemingly deleted from existence without warning.\n\n**Temporary Workaround Found:** Toggle Vacation Mode on/off to reindex your shop. Warning: only works for \\~24 hours and may affect long-term ranking.\n\n**Currently building a master list of affected shops to present to Etsy.** If you're affected, please add your details below.\n\nIf you know other Etsy sellers, let them know about this. Many don't realize they're affected - they just think it's a slow period. The more data we collect, the better chance we have of getting this resolved.\n\n**For those affected:** You're not alone, your shop isn't broken, you didn't do anything wrong. This is a platform issue that needs immediate attention.\n\nThe more visibility this gets, the more likely Etsy will acknowledge and fix this critical bug that's destroying small businesses.\n\n**EDIT: Check this thread I found** [Etsy Community](https://community.etsy.com/forum/technical-issues-301/topic/multiple-shops-completely-gone-from-search-since-nov-6-need-answers-from-etsy-team-159689/) and you'll see it's a real issue affecting multiple shops. For those who are not experiencing it, it's counter-intuitive -&gt; multiple shops vanished from search + best month of the year in terms of sales -&gt; better results for those who are not affected. So please, let's try and bump to the top the comments of people who are actually experiencing this issue.\n\nIt is a **real issue - a complete deindexing, not a shop-rotation issue -** and Etsy team suggest that we just let it go and there's nothing wrong when there's clearly something wrong since Nov 6-7.\n\n**FINAL UPDATE - THEY'RE LISTENING, SO LET'S GET LOUDER:**\n\nAfter days of being told by customer support that **we were imagining things**, that it was just \"normal fluctuations\" or we needed to \"fix our SEO,\" the overwhelming evidence in this thread and on the forums has forced their hand. **Etsy moderators are now publicly admitting they are \"investigating the issue.\"**\n\nThis is a direct result of our collective pressure. **But an \"investigation\" is not a solution.** It's a delay tactic they may use to get us to quiet down while our shops continue to bleed money during the **most critical sales period of the year.**\n\nWe cannot afford to be complacent. Now is the moment to **step on the gas.** The silent majority—the thousands of sellers who were dismissed by support, who don't frequent forums, who think this is just a \"slow week\"—still need to know this is a **documented, platform-breaking bug.**\n\nIf you are reading this, **spread the word.** Share this thread in your private Facebook groups, on Twitter, with your fellow sellers, anywhere you can. We need to turn our hundreds of voices into thousands. Don't let them forget what this is costing us. Let's keep the pressure on.\n\nAnd for the sellers who haven't been affected: **I made this thread so things like these don't happen to people like you in the future.**\n\nIf we don't speak up and instead we choose to censor real issues, then others will suffer too from our ignorance.\n\nNow please, **spread the word and help out the community**.\n\n**OK.... SO, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT??**\n\nAs days go by, people realize that Etsy's way of handling things is **extremely disappointing**.\n\nSellers are expected to provide excellent customer experience or face penalties. The fact that Etsy **didn't extend the same courtesy** during a crisis has been a damaging aspect in terms of trust and respect. And so, this has naturally led to discussions about what comes next...\n\nA simple fix may no longer be enough to restore confidence. Some are now raising the critical question of whether Etsy will issue a **public apology** or how it intends to compensate businesses for the losses they suffered.\n\nAs documented by u/Busy-Apple-41, posts about this bug are being locked or deleted in major seller Facebook groups. We have also observed threads on the main Etsy Sellers subreddit being removed or not approved, just as that space becomes flooded with posts celebrating massive success.\n\nWe are genuinely happy for every single seller who is having a record-breaking month. **Your success is a testament to your hard work, and we celebrate it**. At the same time, a healthy community must be able to address problems openly. Suppressing legitimate concerns doesn't solve the problem-&gt; it only isolates those who are struggling.\n\n**As other avenues for discussion are being censored, this thread may be one of the last spaces where sellers can safely share their experience. For this reason, we must continue to document everything here and amplify this message.**\n\n**We've moved past the era of one-way corporate communication. A company's interests and its community's voice are now permanently linked. We are now in a place where dialogue is not a courtesy, but a necessity. Everyone, platform or individual, must respect and honor the future we're building together.**\n\n**Keep sharing your story here. Reach out to YouTubers, bloggers, and influencers who cover Etsy. Until Etsy speaks, the voice of this community** ***is*** **the accountability.**\n\n**---&gt; A Final Thought for Everyone Who Has Followed This Journey &lt;---**\n\n**We have over 100 new documented cases but the thread is too long to add further names.**\n\nEtsy has not come out with an official statement in five weeks, and this thread has now been seen nearly 200,000 times. That number is a testament to how widespread the concern is. Yet, it also means that for every person who spoke up, hundreds watched in silence.\n\nIt seems our modern culture has conditioned us to avoid a problem that isn't directly ours. If our own shop is safe today, it feels easier to scroll past another's crisis. But in the future, new issues are inevitable: we might face a sudden policy change, a new fee structure, or a different technical glitch. And it could be your shop, your income, your years of hard work on the line.\n\nWhen that day comes, the strength of this community will be the only real safety net we have. This thread, therefore, has become more than a record of a problem. It is now an appeal for solidarity. A call to build a community that doesn't just react to individual fires, but works together to fireproof the entire house.\n\nWe had hoped to resolve this through dialogue - they failed us. This was never about childish games, such as demanding punitive justice. This is about the most powerful principle in human existence: **the truth, and the truth alone, will make its way to the top.**\n\nFor this reason, I ask everyone who believes in this principle (whether your are a seller or a buyer), to consider taking one small, constructive action. **Please consider writing a polite and professional message to** [`press@etsy.com`](mailto:press@etsy.com) and [`legal@etsy.com`](mailto:legal@etsy.com) **expressing your concern and including a link to this thread.** A simple message like, *\"I am writing to express my concern about the widespread technical issues reported by sellers since early November, as documented in this thread \\[link\\]. I would appreciate an official update from Etsy on this matter,\"* would be incredibly powerful if sent by many.\n\nCustomer support failed us. Now it is the time to contact official channels, this being the only way to ensure our collective, documented concerns land on the desks of people who definitely know what's up with this.\n\n**This is for all of us, fellow sellers and shoppers. This is for Etsy's well-being and reputation as well. We must make sure this becomes a turning point in an industry that's still playing old games with innocent people.**\n\n**Keep sharing your story and speak up your truth!**",

    "text": "OOCS, Into A Wider Galaxy, Part 502\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/)\n\n(Sorry! Lost all track of time!)\n\nIt’s Inevitable\n\nAs he hardens his stomach he for the entry into zero gravity he hears the sound of a baby laughing. Observer Wu then descends further and finds the Jamesons with little Miracle laughing as she acclimatizes to zero gravity and how much she can move. Her family is nearby, particularly the empty clothing of Rain and the small and quick Javra, to ensure she’s perfectly safe as she squirms her neck in midair and giggles at the movement this lets her do.\n\n“I see that you’re enjoying yourselves.” Observer Wu notes.\n\n“Well The Dauntless itself is fairly crowded and our time with The Inevitable is nearing a finality. She won’t remember this, but we’ll remember how much she enjoyed this when she’s older.”\n\n“For some reason he’s getting melancholic.”\n\n“She hatched within the walls of The Inevitable, and soon enough The Inevitable will be in Cruel Space, potentially to never return from it. I want to make sure she gets everything she can out of this opportunity.” Harold states and Observer Wu smiles.\n\n“It’s fine. But I do need you to tuck to the side for a moment. I have business in The RAD.”\n\n“There’s more than enough room.”\n\n“It’s more a warning. You’re playing with an infant after all.” Observer Wu notes as he pushes to the side and lets the magnetic rail catch onto the ‘cuff-links’ in his jacket. Not quite the rank insignia the soldiers and crewmen of the ship use, but still functional.\n\nHe’s pulled along and offers a smile as little Miracle catches sight of him. She tries to hold his gaze and sends herself gently tumbling through the air, which distracts her into a giggling fit. She’s clearly well suited for zero-gravity.\n\nHe catches his ladder near the end and swings onto the rungs to quickly climb up. He flexes his stomach muscles to get over the churning sensation that returning to gravity gives him. He had asked about it before. The answer was simple. Organs have sensory input and the sensation of them going weightless or suddenly gaining gravity is so novel that it stands out. The Churning is their natural processes, your just wired to ignore it. Unless you’re paying attention for some reason. Like say, because something novel was happening with the organs?\n\nStill unpleasant. But not in the slightest bit dangerous. Not unless you were going from no gravity to ten or more times natural gravity. Then you could hurt yourself. But if you’re going into ten times standard gravity, you have other problems.\n\nThe airlock leading to The RAD cycles quickly, opens wide and he steps through. The system is efficient with easy manual overrides. Apparently the designers for the emergency systems had had nightmares trying to figure out what the hell to do if someone’s spacesuit got breached and they needed to get back in the ship in a hurry. The answer was an easy manual override. But the tricky part was making it.\n\n“Observer. Good to see you.” One of the scientists working there says indicating a large stack of papers he has ready. “We have the hard copy of the data-cache you requested, ready for your review.”\n\n“Thank you.” Observer Wu says as he takes the stack’s topmost paper and begins scanning. It looks good so far. He gives the entire stack a quick scan and nods. Most of this he can only vaguely understand about wavelengths, frequencies and potential power levels. It was the data that they and The Undaunted had gathered during the resurrection on Skathac. The energies had corroded the equipment in a hurry, the frequency of light had somehow burnt out the cameras and the song had shaken the microphones so badly they had come apart. Which was bizarre as equipment that could not pick up sound did not have that happen to them. Which is NOT how sound works.\n\nThe same with the ‘light’. Light is a form of radiation that leaves traces of itself behind when it impacts things. But they could not find any trace of anything. Whatever had poured out of The Other Direction, it hadn’t been sound and it hadn’t been light. But it had been interpreted as such.\n\nWhich was really confusing.\n\n“Problems sir?” The scientist asks having somehow conjured a large coffee in the moments of Observer Wu glancing at the papers. He checks his watch. He had been ‘glancing’ at the paper for the past hour and a half.\n\n“Only that the lack of answers for some of these questions isn’t what we’re looking for. But there’s no way I can actually demand someone find answers without it being unreasonable, impractical or simply impossible.”\n\n“To be fair sir, we’re out here to learn if The Undaunted were lying to us and if so, then by how much. And so far the answer seems to be, yes, but through understatement alone.” He says and Observer Wu nods.\n\n“Which is the problem. That’s not a good answer, and some of the questions they’ve raised...” He says as he flips back to the image of the ‘angel’ that had approached. It was stock still and he could only see well made, but patchwork clothing wrapped around something vaguely feminine, winged and with six arms.\n\n“Harold and Banshee both swear they can see something made of crystal in that picture. But it’s not possible sir, that image is of an artist’s recreation of an image of the creature. They used nothing in the way of pigments to suggest anything like that.”\n\n“More the mystery then.” Observer Wu says. “Did they know they were being tested?”\n\n“Banshee didn’t, but keeping secrets with Harold around is an exercise in frustration on a good day.” The Scientist says.\n\n“Hmm...”\n\n“The absolute bastard actually showed up right as we finished with Banshee, took the picture himself and not only confirmed he could see her too, pointing out details alongside Banshee for a few moments, but took a picture with his communicator and could still see it in a picture of a picture that never once had any part of her beyond her clothing in it. I’m not entirely sure he’s not screwiing with us, but we have no way of knowing.”\n\n“Maybe you do.” Observer Wu notes.\n\n“Observer Sir?”\n\n“There are others beyond Harold and Banshee that can see beyond. Herbert might be suspect, but he has been modified much like his clone. He also has infant children and they have infant clones. If they react to parts of the images ‘face’ or anatomy in a way that’s noticeably different than another child.”\n\n“Maybe, but they’re infants. Babies. Not even capable of saying more than a word or two. Stringing two or three together if they’re really precocious.” The Scientist says. “The data would be... well it would be authentic. They don’t even have a concept for lying, but it would be difficult to actually gather. How do you track eye movements on someone with completely blank eyes?”\n\n“I’m sure you’re already well on your way to brainstorming a solution. We sent out with the best and brightest after all.”\n\n‘Yeah, second place best and brightest. I was pushed out of The Dauntless. Other men made the grade better than I could.” He says somewhat grimly.\n\n“Something you want to say?”\n\n“No... yes? Maybe. I can’t help but have suspicions at times. The Undaunted were the best we had, everyone on this ship was either overflow or second best with a few extra rounds of raw loyalty and heavy bribes to not go rogue locked in. But that doesn’t change the fact that the best we have on our little fleet were the bunkmates, training buddies and allies to the very people we’re out here to judge. I personally want to make sure I know what happened with complete certainty. But I still have friends. Polido and I were study buddies, and she was one of the few women to get onto The Dauntless. I had never drank so much as the night I celebrated with her, and mourned the fact I wasn’t going out with her at the same time. And now... now I may or may not be part of declaring her a traitor.”\n\n“And yet you use her last name?”\n\n“She thought Janet sounded too preppy. She prefers her family name of Polido.”\n\n“Were you possibly going to be more?’\n\n“If we had flown out together, maybe we would have been more. But we were just friends then. Good ones. But friends are friends.”\n\n“You can relax. Even if they were traitors, which they have more or less demonstrably proven they are not, then ninety percent of the blame would fall on the heads of commanders. And any scientist, lawyer or the like would have been offered amnesty in return for cooperation.”\n\n“I will admit Observer Sir, I’m having a hard time imagining them being traitors, but at the same time, I can’t really imagine them not being declared traitors. You know some people will try.”\n\n“And those that do will lose all credit. They publicly vetted and tested and trained me. I am the trusted word to Earth. After all that song and dance, turning around and calling me a liar is not only political suicide, but social suicide as well.”\n\n“And suicide is a virtual unknown on Earth. Existing only in theory and never in practice.” The Scientist says in a vaguely bitter tone.\n\n“Yes, that is a problem. But the fact of the matter is that we have limits. We cannot control the world. Only do our best to serve it as best we can and hope that it is made the better through our service.”\n\n“Even if it’s unworthy of it?”\n\n“My master right or wrong.” Observer Wu says simply and he gets a look. Observer Wu looks him dead in the eye and finishes his saying. “If right, to be kept right. If wrong, to be made right.”\n\n“... I understand.”\n\n“Good.”\n\n“I’m glad to hear it. And remember, it’s not the clink of coins that corrupts. It’s the silence of those who hear it.”\n\n“How did you live to your age in China of all places?”\n\n“Simple. Shine so bright that no amount of hurled filth can dim your light.”\n\n“Simple he says...”\n\n“True. Simple to understand, hard to accomplish.” Observer Wu states. “Now, I have some questions about Primals.”\n\n“Primals sir?”\n\n“Mister Jameson has floated the idea of a Primal potentially accompanying us to Earth. I’ve learned not to discount anything he says. But is it even possible? While Primals are effectively immortal on record, are there any scenarios they have been killed in? And more importantly, how do they react to Null Exposure? Do they react to Null Exposure? Or are they Immune?”\n\n“Excellent questions sir. It shouldn’t be too hard there’s only so... only so many of them but they’re all so long lived and well documented that I’m looking at entire petabytes of data to sift through on the low end.”\n\n“To say nothing about separating the facts from the fantasy. I’m afraid I haven’t asked you a simple question.”\n\n“You haven’t, but thankfully I am a geek and I am with my people. Ape together strong Observer Sir.”\n\n“Ooh Ooh Ahh Ahh.” Observer Wu imitates a gorilla’s grunting before smiling. “Get to work Scientist. I need answers.”\n\n“Yes Observer Sir.” The man says with a salute that’s technically not required and then heads off. Observer Wu smiles as he collects the documents back into order, tucks them under his arm and starts to leave The RAD. He needs to go over this in finer detail.\n\nIt should only take the rest of the trip to Centris. Hopefully he’ll have some time to rest and recharge as he will have much more to do when they arrive.\n\nThere is a small note in his office when he arrives back. “Of course.”\n\nHe sets the documents to one side and examines the note. It’s from Harold, he knows about what he’s researching and he’s offering to twist some arms in the Primal Faith and use his new status as Saint Redblade to get more information out.\n\n“Not sure what I expected.” Observer Wu notes as he puts the note down, and then notices there is more on the back. ‘Neither am I.’\n\nHe scrunches his eyes together. “Mister Jameson, please stop the clairvoyance routine. It’s exhausting on a good day.”\n\n“Sorry!” Jameson’s voice echoes to him. From the vent.\n\n“Are you in there or is it just a device?” Observer Wu asks pointedly not looking at the vent he’d have a hard time hiding a loaf of bread in, let alone a full grown man.\n\n“... I’m leaving.”\n\n“He’s actually in the vent...”\n\n“I got held up by a cleaning drone! I was getting non teleportation or phasing based infiltration practice in.”\n\n“And just cranking up your stealth field is untenable because?”\n\n“Because this is training and cheating in training is just cheating yourself.”\n\n“Because THAT’s the issue with this situation.”\n\n“Hasn’t it been long confirmed by this point that there’s no place on the ship that isn’t open to me on a casual basis?” Harold asks.\n\n“I like to forget that. I know you’ll find your way in here eventually again. But until we reach Centris I want you to stay out of my office and quarters.”\n\n“I have not gone into anyone’s quarters or bathrooms. But I’ll stay out of your office until then. After we land though I need to be on high alert for infiltration and sabotage. Centris is insane.”\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ots88g/oocs_into_a_wider_galaxy_part_501/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ovk82u/oocs_into_a_wider_galaxy_part_503/)",

    "text": "doc wants to sterilize 11yo girl....I think maybe I should...?\nTW: all of it\n\nmy daughter is autistic.  profound. she's 11 and non verbal,  she refuses to go to school,  she refuses to use her aac, she has pcos, sibs, severe mood swings.  I love her to death. but she cannot be left unsupervised in any capacity. \n\n she has very poor hygiene, I have to physically give her a shower,  like get in with her,  wash her hair and body,  she goes thru the motion but does not throughly clean herself when using the bathroom,  she only gets cleaned up properly if I do it for her. she sometimes stims by screaming in a loud and screeching voice.  I have a 13 yo nt child. we live paycheck to paycheck.  I work full time,  nights,  and everything about our life is so hard.  every day is so very hard.  I make too much to get assistance, but barely enough to feed them.  I've been denied for disability (for her) even though she is clearly severely disabled.\n\n  now cps is chasing me down because her rbt called the fkg hotline and told them that she doesn't get bathed (this is very much not the case) but she doesn't clean herself well and she wets the bed and her undies frequently, plus she has a strong odor from the hormones and wearing the period panties when she's menstruating since she won't use pads and I can't even fathom teaching her to use a tampon\n\nat the last endocrinologist appt, he very casually suggested I sterilize my baby girl by letting him refer her for a hysterectomy (due to the pcos and her inability to care for herself) and I (I do not ever cry,  in public esp) completely broke down sobbing in that office.  I realized in an instant that my very unrealistic dreams of some medicine,  some breakthrough,  some day.... this would all get better.... were a complete fantasy.... and it's only going to get worse.  the idea of taking this choice away from my only daughter kills me.... but like... what other choice do I have.  I so badly want to just throw in the towel and stop this horrible life of mine.  but then my son would be in foster care and so would she.  and I can't bear that thought.  but my God.  this is so fkg awful.   \n\nI guess I'm looking for some reassurance that is the right thing to do.  I wanted to start birth control to help with the mood swings anyways,  but it's worrisome bc she won't take any medication willingly, I have to crush up and hide in her koolaid or yogurt for her to actually take it,  and it's iffy if she will actually consume the full dose.  I do logically think it's the right thing to do,  but it breaks my heart and I don't think I could live with myself if she ever gets to a point in her life where she wants a family but I've taken that choice away (to be clear,  I do not think that she would ever get to that point,  I believe that is my wishful thinking)....\n\nETA UPDATE: \n\nThis got a ton of feedback and I can't respond to all of them but I wanted to update this to say that I am literally  in tears reading all of your warm comments and kindness and support.  I'm not the type usually to seek out internet validation but you guys really lifted my spirits and wanted to thank you.   when I left that dr office I was a compete wreck and think I really needed to vent but I didn't imagine so much support. ❤️ \n\nso to address some of the comments I will say that first off, I do have a village,  it's small,  but their dad and I, though divorced,  are a great team and he really loves and cares for them as much as I do, we are going to make this decision together. \n\nsecond,  alternative options:   we have already ruled out the implant bc she has (diagnosed) OCD, she can't even tolerate a sticker or bandaid or hair clip,  nothing like that,  so we are 100% sure that the implant is not a viable option.  the shot IS def an option,  as are the pills, there are pros and cons we are considering for both,  we are not taking this decision lightly.  the surgery would be uterus only,  not ovaries. I don't know enough yet if this will help with her obvious pain, discomfort. and mood swings she has due to her cycle.  \n\non that note,  she has not been dx with it,  but I do suffer from pmdd and I suspect she does also.  she has been getting her period for just over a year now and in the beginning,  she would spend 3 days before bleeding  throwing up everything she ate,  Dr's told me this was due to hormone fluctuations, she doesn't do this anymore but we can always tell when she is about to start bc her whole demeanor changes,  she is so angry,  irritable, melt downs at the drop of a hat,  in obvious pain as she will often double over and hit herself in her stomach. her periods are irregular due to pcos so this might be anywhere from 2-4 weeks apart.  I suspect pmdd and this is another reason we want SOME form of bc, whether that is a shot,  a pill or a hysterectomy I have already decided that she needs some form of bc, to address these issues,  not bc I am worried about pregnancy. \n\nI also saw many comments about support.  as I said,  my ex husband, their dad,  is very supportive but we do struggle financially and I have every intention of pursuing disability for her,  if only to set up something for when I'm gone,  I worry about this a lot bc there are just no savings.  her brother is less than 2 years older than her and I can't expect him to take on her lifelong care when I'm gone.  he is wonderful and loves her to death but it's also such an unfair to him situation.  it's hard with working nights to get much done during the day, but I will be trying to get in touch with a lawyer who can help with getting her into ssi so that I can start planning for her future.  \n\nwe have a follow up in about 3 months.  I will take this time to consider what's right and best for her,  and I won't say that I won't consider my own and my sons needs also,  what's best for her is to be surrounded by love and calm bc she is chaos incarnate.  I will say that I'm leaning towards trying the shot for a year or so before committing to surgery.  \n\nI  will also say that everyone who has pcos or autism or both, sharing your experiences with me has been so invaluable to me and your opinions are not only valid and insightful but also give me hope and comfort knowing that whatever decision we come to will be the right one for her,  so thank you ❤️",

    "text": "EXPOSED: SEC CHAIR GENSLER'S VANISHED TEXTS – The 2021 GME Squeeze Cover-Up And The Digital Black Hole Threatening Market Justice\n**MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD: DUE DILIGENCE REPORT ON SEC OIG FINDINGS REGARDING LOSS OF FORMER CHAIR GARY GENSLER'S TEXT MESSAGES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR GAMESTOP CORP. ($GME) TRANSPARENCY**\n\n**PUBLIC SUBMISSION FOR:** **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Justice (DOJ)**\n\n**From:** **[Agent 31337 - Job’s Not Finished.]**\n\n**Date:** November 3, 2025  \n\n**Re:** Analysis of SEC OIG Special Review Report No. 587 on Avoidable Errors Leading to Loss of Gensler's Text Messages: Potential Implications for Withheld Communications During 2021 GME Events Under Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) and Securities Exchange Act § 10(b) (15 U.S.C. § 78j(b))  \n\n**Classification:** Unclassified - **LIGMA**\n\n**I. Executive Summary and Purpose**\n\nThis memorandum examines the September 3, 2025, SEC Office of Inspector General (OIG) Special Review Report No. 587, which details \"avoidable errors\" resulting in the loss of nearly one year of text messages from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler (January 2021 to December 2021). The report attributes the deletions to a combination of mobile device management (MDM) system failures, inadequate retention policies, and non-compliance with federal records laws, recommending five corrective actions for SEC-wide implementation. The timeframe overlaps precisely with the January 2021 GameStop Corp. ($GME) short squeeze when Gensler oversaw emergency trading halts and NSCC collateral demands exceeding $3.7 billion raising concerns over lost records potentially relevant to FOIA requests on market manipulation, FTDs, and regulatory coordination.\n\n*The OIG found no intentional misconduct* **(I call bullshit)** *but highlighted systemic lapses: over 500 texts erased during routine device wipes, with logs incomplete and backups unsearchable. This \"groundbreaking\" revelation SEC's first public admission of such a tech purge under Gensler shocks due to its timing amid ongoing GME litigation (e.g., class actions alleging collusion). No criminality is alleged; the facts underscore transparency deficits warranting federal audit. All data is from the official OIG report and SEC filings.*\n\n**II. Factual Background: OIG Review and GME Overlap**\n\nThe OIG review, initiated in response to congressional inquiries and FOIA disputes, scrutinized SEC's handling of Gensler's Samsung Galaxy devices from his 2021-2024 tenure. **Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. § 3101) mandates preservation of official communications, including texts on personal devices used for business.** Gensler's tenure began January 2021, coinciding with GME's 2,500% surge and SEC's January 28, 2021, coordination with FINRA/NSCC on broker restrictions. Over 1,200 FOIA requests on GME (2021-2025) yielded &lt;1% full grants, often citing exemptions for \"deliberative\" processes now complicated by lost records.\n\n**III. Precise Data and Evidence from OIG Report**\n\n**A. Scope of Lost Messages**  \n\n- **Timeframe**: January 2021 to December 2021 (full year under Gensler's early chairmanship).  \n\n- **Volume**: Approximately 500+ text messages permanently deleted; exact count unrecoverable due to incomplete MDM logs.  \n\n- **Cause**: Routine device factory resets (e.g., for upgrades) without prior archiving; MDM system (Microsoft Intune) failed to capture off-network texts, and no automated backups existed for SMS/MMS.  \n\n- **Direct Quote**: \"Avoidable errors in the SEC’s management of mobile devices and federal records led to the loss of nearly a year of text messages from former Chair Gary Gensler.\" (Report, Executive Summary, p. 1).  \n\n- **GME Tie**: Overlaps 100% with January 2021 events; OIG notes potential relevance to \"high-profile market events\" but defers specifics to ongoing probes.  \n\n- **Verified Link**: Full OIG Report PDF: https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-oig-review-587-2025.pdf (pp. 1-3, Executive Summary and Findings).  \n\n**B. Systemic Failures Identified**  \n\n- **MDM Logging Gaps**: Intune captured only 60% of device activity; off-WiFi texts (40% of Gensler's usage) unlogged.  \n\n- **Retention Policy Non-Compliance**: SEC's 2020 policy required monthly exports, but Gensler exported only sporadically (e.g., quarterly batches); no enforcement.  \n\n- **Backup Inadequacies**: No searchable archives; deleted texts irrecoverable post-90-day carrier retention.  \n\n- **Direct Quote**: \"The SEC’s mobile device management system did not capture all federal records... leading to the inadvertent deletion of approximately one year of text messages.\" (Report, p. 5, Finding 1).  \n\n- **Verified Link**: Full OIG Report PDF: https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-oig-review-587-2025.pdf (pp. 4-7, Findings 1-2).  \n\n**C. Recommendations and SEC Response**  \n\n- **Five Recommendations**: (1) Implement automated text capture; (2) Enhance MDM logging for 100% coverage; (3) Mandate bi-weekly exports; (4) Develop searchable archives; (5) Annual compliance audits.  \n\n- **SEC Concurrence**: Full agreement; implementation timeline: Q1 2026 for tech upgrades, with interim manual processes.  \n\n- **Direct Quote**: \"The SEC concurs with all recommendations and will implement enhanced controls to prevent future losses.\" (Report, p. 12, SEC Response).  \n\n- **GME/FOIA Impact**: The report's findings directly complicate GME-related FOIA requests, as lost messages may include deliberations on the $3.7B collateral spike or Rule 204 waivers during the 2021 squeeze.  \n\n- **Verified Link**: SEC OIG Landing Page: https://www.sec.gov/oig/special-review-avoidable-errors-led-loss-former-sec-chair-gary-genslers-text-messages-report-no-587 (includes report and response).  \n\n**D. Broader Context Metrics**  \n\n- **FOIA Denial Rate**: 99% for GME-specific requests (2021-2025: 1,200 submitted, 12 fully granted), per OIG cross-reference.  \n\n- **Device Usage**: Gensler averaged 150 texts/month on business matters; lost year equates to ~1,800 messages potentially relevant to market events.  \n\n- **Verified Link**: OIG Report PDF: https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-oig-review-587-2025.pdf (p. 8, Table 1: Usage Stats).  \n\n**IV. Analysis: Shocking Implications for Corruption and Transparency**\n\nThe OIG's admission of a full-year text purge under Gensler precisely during GME's crisis shatters illusions of SEC accountability, exposing tech-enabled opacity that could conceal coordination on trading halts, FTD tolerances, or broker exemptions. While \"avoidable errors\" absolve intent, the non-searchable backups and 60% logging gap mirror broader FOIA evasions, fueling suspicions of shielded collusion (e.g., with Citadel/NSCC). In GME context, lost messages may include deliberations on the $3.7B collateral spike or Rule 204 waivers, undermining 2025 class actions. This isn't malice but negligence at scale shocking for a $2 quadrillion clearinghouse overseer demanding clawbacks and reforms to restore trust.\n\n**V. Recommendations for Investigation**\n\nSubpoena Gensler's device logs/carrier records for recovery attempts; audit all 2021 SEC texts for GME relevance; integrate with Missouri AG probes for state-federal synergy; mandate AI-assisted FOIA processing.\n\n**End of Memorandum**  \n\n**[Agent 31337 - You think I’m finished? I’m coming after everyone.]**\n\n**[FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, POWER TO THE PLAYERS]**\n\n**Appendix: Sources**  \n\n- OIG Special Review Report No. 587: https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-oig-review-587-2025.pdf  \n\n- SEC OIG Landing Page: https://www.sec.gov/oig/special-review-avoidable-errors-led-loss-former-sec-chair-gary-genslers-text-messages-report-no-587",

    "text": "I got a Senior Member Success Associate at GLG to review my expert profile and talk to me 1:1 for 30 minutes. Here's the call transcript.\nIntro:  \nI'm a month into using GLG and was struggling to get consultations confirmed. I reached out, and surprisingly, they offered a 30-minute consultation with someone whose entire job it is to help their expert members.\n\nSo I cleaned up the transcript for easier reading and skimming while keeping all the information and the full 1:1 interview there for you. Of course I asked about rates and their inner workings, too, and they were not shy about giving me real answers.\n\nI feel like I understand the game a lot better now, and I wish the same for you!!\n\nTL;DR:  \n\\- Be hyper-specific with keywords. Name actual tools and companies a lot. Also name the specifics of your industry terms, such as revenue types or business models.  \n\\- $330-400/hr is the sweet spot for executives  \n\\- System gets smarter over time, and providing screening answers is a part of it.  \n\\- In your answers to screening questions, tie back to your experience as much as possible. Share numbers, names, durations. That part is more important than actually giving your opinion or prediction.  \n\\- Focus on last 2 years of experience in your work history. That's where you need the keywords and detail.  \n\\- Be proactive but patient.\n\n———————————\n\n# FULL CALL TRANSCRIPT\n\n**Date:** October 2025  \n**Participants:**  Growth Marketing Expert (marketing strategy, technology, AI trends), Senior Member Success Associate at GLG\n\n# Profile Setup &amp; Specificity\n\n**Expert member:** I find that my biggest strengths are marketing strategy, marketing technology (B2B SaaS companies implementing AI), and AI trends in marketing—especially language models for search. I've tried to set up my profile with a lot of detail on that and my work history. Do you think it's clear that those are my forte, or what should I do differently?\n\n**GLG Associate:** The themes you've indicated—tech, software, AI, and marketing strategy—are highlighted in your profile, but I'd recommend making additional updates. It's good to have general umbrellas, but if we have very broad topics, we're going to send you very broad topics. If you're very focused on certain things, the more specific you can get, the better we can match you.\n\nFor example, in your self-employed advisor role, you mention marketing heads, investors, and B2B SaaS technology in health and education. If there are specific language models—certain companies or processes—name them specifically. What kind of retention processes are you familiar with? What kinds of revenue models have you optimized?\n\n**Expert member:** You mean revenue such as monthly recurring revenue? That kind of specificity?\n\n**GLG Associate:** Exactly. We don't want to think you have some aspect of revenue expertise that you may not be familiar with, but we think you might be. The more specific and detailed you can get with what you add to your profile, the better job we'll do of inviting you to projects. It'll save you time because you won't have to tell us \"this isn't my expertise.\"\n\nLooking at your Managing Director role with GrowthX AI, you've done a really good job. If there are specific AI workflow software for content creation that you're familiar with—models that have names—list them. I think it's great that you included the clients you worked with, like Reddit, Ramp, Vapi, Innerwell. If we have clients looking into those spaces or industry overviews, that's helpful.\n\nI also really like how you included processes like AirOps, AirTable, Google Docs, Gemini, Notion, Profound, Circle, ChatGPT. That's fantastic, and I'd encourage you to use that kind of formatting and detail in all your descriptions.\n\n**Expert member:** Do you think the GrowthX AI work experience is specific enough when it comes to the names? I was trying to make that effort there.\n\n**GLG Associate:** I think it's a really strong entry. But I'm of the mind that nothing is ever perfect. If you think at a later time you left something out, or there's something adjacent that would help us—add it. We won't know about it unless you tell us.\n\nOne other thing: our system prioritizes net new information. If you say \"I'm familiar with business model, I am a businessman, I have business experience\"—that's not as important as just saying \"I have business experience\" once. Using repetitive phrases means our system treats it like the word \"the\"—it doesn't come up in search algorithms because it's used multiple times. Being concise while also detailed will really help.\n\n**Expert member:** So like monthly recurring revenue, annual recurring revenue, incremental revenue—I should probably mention B2B SaaS more times, mention e-commerce, mention affiliate, that type of thing?\n\n**GLG Associate:** Yes. And you could phrase it as \"I'm familiar with revenue processes such as monthly recurring, incremental, annual recurring\" and list it that way rather than repeating the word \"revenue\" over and over again.\n\n# Additional Profile Tips\n\n**GLG Associate:** Your Gospace Labs role is good. If there are specific things about team structuring, hiring plans, or certain marketing channels you're familiar with—be specific. \"Marketing\" could mean social media initiatives or local newspaper ads. List which marketing channels you know. If you used a certain company to implement ads on a website, add that.\n\nFor your MarketingOps. com course, if there are specific types of automations you're familiar with, add those.\n\nYour Daydreams role is well detailed. If there are certain partnerships with other companies, co-promotion partnerships, or specific distribution channels you can name, that would be helpful.\n\nYour Head of Backlinko role at SEMrush is really strong. Including SOPs creation, specific teams, and listing competitors like Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, SpyFu, SEranking, Serpstat, Mangools—that's really helpful because sometimes our clients will be looking into a competitive space. Honestly, I don't see anything I would specifically call out to improve there.\n\n**Expert member:** I was almost worried I'd overdo it with the Semrush and Backlinko experience—keyword cluttering it. I wouldn't do it this way on LinkedIn. But here it sounds like that's exactly what you want?\n\n**GLG Associate:** Keyword cluttering won't be an issue unless you're writing a dissertation for every entry. We don't want that—it's not a good use of your time. But being really detailed with robust and concise information is totally fine.\n\nLet me explain how our teams search: If a client comes to us and says \"I want to know about process improvement for milk cartons because the cardboard we're using is too heavy and not cost-effective,\" they'll say \"we want people with purchasing experience with certain materials, supply chain experience.\" They're using keywords like \"certain types of cardboard, plastic, supply chain, ground transportation\" to find people. We'll skim and say \"you know about this, you have experience with this,\" then match and invite you.\n\nHaving all those keywords and detailed information will make you come up in different kinds of searches for different aspects of projects, ultimately helping us connect you with more clients.\n\n**Expert member:** How much does your system look at what's in your system versus still scouring LinkedIn and evaluating me based on LinkedIn?\n\n**GLG Associate:** That's dependent on the type of project. For a really in-depth engagement like due diligence that's going to be many weeks, we might spend more time digging into your LinkedIn, looking at a resume or CV, having a screening call to really dive into your experience before we invest—and you invest—a lot of time.\n\nBut for something like a survey—10 to 20 questions, $50—we might not go to your LinkedIn because it's a shorter engagement.\n\nFor the most part, we trust our experts to update their work history and biography and provide complete, robust information. So by default, we'll look at your GLG profile, not LinkedIn, unless you're responding to a project and say \"I started work at X company on this month\" and it's not in your profile. Then we might check LinkedIn to see if we're missing something.\n\nLinkedIn is more used when our recruiting team is looking to bring new network members into our network—because we don't have any of their information yet, but we see on LinkedIn what they may be specialized in.\n\n# Recent Work History Priority\n\n**GLG Associate:** Looking at your other entries with Chosen Data and MashMetrics—the agency founder and director of analytics roles—those are great entries. I wouldn't recommend adding much more because our teams primarily look at the last two years or so of work history. Our clients are looking for people with recent experience, former employees of certain companies in a competitive space. Those entries are helpful to have, but don't spend too much time on them since they're outside that 2-year window. Focus on the more recent entries.\n\n# Conversion Rate &amp; Getting Confirmations\n\n**Expert member:** I've been system-identified for maybe 10 opportunities. I've declined about five, applied to five, and received zero confirmations. Earlier this week I was manually contacted over text and email, applied, and that's still showing as active. Is that a normal success rate? What could I be doing better? And is it normal that system-identified opportunities have a lower success rate than when I'm reached out to by your co-workers?\n\n**GLG Associate:** I've realized you're relatively new—you've been in our system about a month. It is kind of normal within that timeframe to not have received many invitations or a consultation yet. It can sometimes take a little time as we're integrating your profile and learning more about you.\n\nAs far as system-recommended opportunities, that's a process we've been building out over time. It takes the information in your profile and suggests things we think might be a match. This is for projects where a project manager indicates \"yes, show this on system recommendations\" because we recognize we might not be able to manually find every single person who knows about a topic. Humans aren't perfect—we'll miss something, and we don't want that to happen.\n\nBecause our clients are picky and maybe looking for something very hyper-specific, those may not always pan out as a really good match initially. But what I've found with network members who've done a lot of work with us—who've had 10 calls this year, 20 calls—those system recommendations actually get stronger over time because there are more screening responses. We know even more about you. So while it may not be a perfect hit rate at first, over the course of your GLG life, those will get better and result in a higher success rate because we'll be learning more and more about you.\n\n**Expert member:** So I'm feeding your system with information about me through the screening responses too. That's smart.\n\n**GLG Associate:** Yes.\n\n**Expert member:** How much does it matter whether I've conducted my first consulting call for GLG already or not? How helpful is it once I've done three compared to zero?\n\n**GLG Associate:** We love to utilize new network members—people with fresh perspectives. That's a good pitch to our clients: \"we have this person, they haven't been utilized yet, but we know they're a really great fit.\"\n\nBut also, doing more engagements will ultimately help you get more engagements. Whenever you're responding to project screening questions—saying \"I know about this type of AI and I have X years of experience with this product\"—we use that information to pitch you as a fit to our client. But it also gets saved in our system's backend, which helps us identify you for more projects.\n\nIf you say you know about a certain process, we save that information. So if we have a client six months from now running a project on a similar topic, we can say \"Branko already knows about this, he already had a successful call, he already responded indicating tons of interest. Let's preview him to the client and say 'do you just want to have a call with him? We already know he's a fit.'\"\n\nIt's okay to not have done anything yet—that's totally fine, we have plenty of people like that. But as you continue to respond to more projects and conduct more calls, you're building yourself up further.\n\n# Hourly Rate Strategy\n\n**Expert member:** I received advice from multiple people—associates and expert network consultants on Reddit—that my rate might have been too low. I started on expert networks last month at about $230 an hour. I've been a head of department, led a team of 25, had budgets of $1–1.5 million a year that I allocated, made large software purchase decisions. I work with VPs, CMOs, and investors a lot. I feel like there was a mismatch between the rate and my experience.\n\nBut when I apply to opportunities on GLG, it shows me the range with my rate at $410 today, and tells me I should consider lowering it to around $200—the average of other experts who have been selected. Did I super overshoot it? What do you think of my rate and how it relates to the opportunities I've been getting?\n\n**GLG Associate:** A higher rate can certainly serve as a deterring factor to our clients. If they're looking to conduct an industry overview or just get a lay of the land and want to conduct 20 calls, they're going to be a lot pickier about who they're deciding to speak with. Choosing higher rates is going to impact the research they're conducting. So having a competitive rate can be really useful and allow you to receive regular consulting engagements.\n\nThe average rate from C-suite executives with varying levels of experience—public company, private company, managing directors—falls around $350 in our network across all different industries, not just AI and tech. In AI and tech, it's a little higher—like $375, somewhere between $350 and $400.\n\nI think having your rate at $410 is a really competitive rate and a good sweet spot to be at. I will say, you're not going to be locked into it forever. If you decide in the future that you want to try raising your rate to make it feel more worthwhile, we can totally do that. And if you feel like it's not helping you get opportunities or you're receiving fewer opportunities, we can revisit and reevaluate later.\n\n**Expert member:** Maybe my question is mainly: if I lower my rate now from $410 to, let's say, $370, is it going to give me more confirmations?\n\n**GLG Associate:** It certainly could, but it will be very dependent on the client. Someone at an investment firm versus someone at a hedge fund versus someone at a small startup trying to get perspectives—each is going to have different priorities and different budgets.\n\nI would say for now, before you've had a call yet, leave it as it is and see how it goes. If there's ever an instance where it's like \"we really want to speak to Branko, the rate's an issue,\" we can reach out to you about it and say \"this particular client is really price-sensitive, would you be willing to lower your rate to X for just this one? What do you think?\" That can be an open conversation too.\n\nBut for now, leave it as it is, see how it goes. Maybe at the end of the year or beginning of 2026, if you still haven't received any traction, we can revisit this conversation and see if there's anything we want to adjust.\n\n# Screening Responses &amp; Availability\n\n**Expert member:** Should I put my availability when I'm applying for an opportunity a few days out or a few weeks out? Like 3 days or 3 weeks out?\n\n**GLG Associate:** I think just a few days in advance is totally fine. Our clients' schedules can fluctuate a lot. So keeping it in the short term is really the best way to do it. If there's ever something where you only indicated until Tuesday but they want the call on Thursday, we'll reach out and say \"client would prefer this day, is there a time that works?\" and go from there.\n\n**Expert member:** In screening responses, I find that sometimes they're asking me \"how does this work? What do you think of this?\" But really, should I probably be answering more about my experience? Like when they ask \"what do you think of this trend in AI content?\"—should I actually say what I think, or should I say \"based on my experience at this company where I had this budget and was working with these tools, this is what I saw and what I foresee for the near future\"? Is it more about qualifying based on my experience, or more about how much they like the insight I'm sharing?\n\n**GLG Associate:** I think it's the qualifier more based on your experience. That's a really good selling point—\"I have this much experience with this, and here's why I know all of these things and can totally speak to every single aspect because of my experience.\" I think that's the best way to go about it and will really give us more of a feel for who you are as an expert.\n\n# Project Status &amp; Timeline\n\n**Expert member:** The opportunity I was manually selected for and applied to early this week—maybe Monday, three or four days back—is still showing as active. I thought these things moved quicker, like clients usually want to find experts quickly. Does this mean it's probably already taking place with other experts and I may be in the next batch? What are the options for what might be happening?\n\n**GLG Associate:** Timeframes can vary by client. Corporate clients may take way longer on certain things. People at hedge funds—if they want to make a deal, they're trying to move really fast, so those might be going frequently.\n\nFor this particular one—the search optimization emerging AEO and GEO trends—I'm seeing the client hasn't proceeded with any calls yet. They're probably just reviewing their options. It could be that somebody at their firm wanted to look at a different angle and they haven't decided which way they want to go yet. I do see that you are an active candidate, and as they continue to review, if we need any additional details or to reconfirm availability, we'll certainly let you know.",

    "text": "I spent my whole life resenting my father. Last night, my mother told me a secret that shattered me.\nMy whole life has been lived under the immense, crushing weight of my father’s expectations. The pressure to be perfect, to be the \"Good Son,\" to become a doctor. I thought I understood the script, the classic Filipino story where the son's success is meant to repay the parents' sacrifice. Resentful ako sa kanya for it, for the pressure, for the anger, for the feeling that my life wasn't my own.\n\nBut to be honest, that was the only real crack in an otherwise perfect facade. Mula pagkabata, everything went my way. Valedictorian, Salutatorian, got into med school. My path was a straight, clean line. I was the golden boy, the family's great hope. I thought my life was a story of smooth sailing, a testament to my own hard work and intelligence.\n\nThen, I failed my board exams.\n\nThat failure was the first domino. It wasn’t just a professional setback; it was a crack in the foundation of my entire identity. The golden boy was tarnished. The straight line of my life had suddenly veered off a cliff.\n\nAkala ko alam ko na lahat. I didn't know a single goddamn thing.\n\nThe days after the PLE were a blur of exhaustion. I went to my Lola’s funeral feeling hollow, like an actor whose play had just closed to bad reviews. Last night, my mother finally told me the secret. The only reason she thinks I'm \"adult enough\" now, at 26, is because I was the one who saw it. I was there at my Lola's funeral. My father had already gone home, good thing he wasn't there to see what happened. I had stayed behind, supposed to represent him for a \"family conference.\" And look what happened. I, alone, saw the whole goddamn thing. The same day they buried their own mother, the siblings exploded into a war over money, pride, and decades of resentment.\n\nI told my mom what I saw. Ang pangit. \"Abysmal conflict resolution skills,\" I said. My witnessing of that chaos, in my father's place, was the final trigger. I heard a sigh on the other end of the line, a sound of deep, ancient weariness. \"Anak,\" she said, her voice quiet, \"there are things you don’t understand about your Papa’s family. Things I think you’re finally old enough to carry.\" And then she knew she had to finally tell me the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is this: My father is the product of an affair. My grandfather brought him home as a little boy. The woman who raised him, the Lola I had just buried, was not his biological mother.\n\nAnd then, my mother told me the final, devastating piece. My Lolo, the man who brought him into that house, was murdered 43 years ago. My father was only seven years old.\n\nSeven. At seven years old, he became an orphan in all but name. The one person who was his link to that family, his only biological claim to his last name, was gone forever. All he had left was my Lola, the woman who wasn't even his real mother, and a family of siblings who already saw him as an outsider.\n\nPutangina. Just like that, the entire chaotic, painful, confusing movie of my father’s life snapped into focus. His rage, the beatings when I was a kid, his constant, desperate need for pride, it was never just about him being a difficult man. It was the lifelong scream of a terrified orphan fighting for his place in the world. It wasn’t just a father’s discipline. It was the desperate, clumsy rage of a man who was never taught how to be a son, trying to teach his own son how to be strong in a world that had only ever been cruel to him. His fight wasn't just for legitimacy. It was a fight for survival.\n\nYung \"half-brother\" comment from my other Tita years ago, it wasn't just an insult. It was her kicking a boy who had already lost everything. The reason he was always excluded, the reason he was the outcast, it wasn't just imagined. It was real. He had no one to advocate for him.\n\nAnd my success, becoming a doctor... fuck. It was never just about bragging rights. It was his weapon against the entire world. I, the son of the orphan, the son of the outcast, was supposed to be the one thing none of their \"legitimate\" children could produce. My title wasn’t just a trophy; it was a social nuke. It was the one thing he could detonate in any family gathering to silence all arguments and prove, once and for all, that he, the bastard, the outsider, had produced the ultimate insider.\n\nNo wonder he was so obsessed. No wonder my failure felt like the end of the world to him. It wasn't his son failing an exam. It was the final, crushing confirmation of a lifetime of being \"less than.\"\n\nAnd my mother... Jesus, my mother. I finally understand her. No wonder she never liked going to their province. No wonder she always said she only comes for my Lola and Tita (eldest daughter), the only sibling who ever truly treated him like family. She wasn't just avoiding family drama. She was refusing to set foot in the territory of the people who had wounded her husband and disrespected her. It wasn't just avoidance; it was a quiet act of loyalty.\n\nSabi niya sa akin kagabi, with this heartbreaking calm, that she \"cannot not love him.\" Siya lang ang meron ang Papa. When he had that horrible accident two decades ago, none of his siblings helped. Not one. His own family left him for dead. It was my Tita, my mother's sister, who stepped in and helped with the expenses. My mother was the only person in his entire life who never, ever walked away.\n\nShe wasn't tolerating him. She was shielding him. Her entire life with him has been an act of radical, thankless, and brutal compassion. She saw this deeply wounded, seven-year-old orphan, and she chose to stand in the gap. He even thanked her for it once, for not giving up on him.\n\nI thought my life was perfect. Now I see I was just living on the quiet, polished surface of a deep, dark ocean of generational trauma. I’m devastated. Not for me. For my father. For the little boy who was brought into a house and then abandoned by fate, left to the mercy of a family that never fully accepted him. For the man who never understood unconditional love. All this time, I've been fighting against his pressure, resenting him. Pero hindi pala kami magkalaban. We were in the same prison, just in different cells. He was fighting for his legitimacy, and I was the tool he was using to try and break out.\n\nUmiyak ako kagabi. Not for my failed exam. I cried for my father. And at that moment, the years of anger and resentment just… evaporated. Wala na. All that’s left is this profound, gut-wrenching sadness.\n\nEverything is different now. The ledger, the performance, the pressure, it all feels like a story about a different person. My own story, I think, is just beginning. And my own healing, it can’t be about escaping anymore. It has to be about turning around and facing this generational wreckage head-on. Maybe it starts with learning to see my father not as the man who wounded me, but as the boy who was wounded first.",

    "text": "Understanding the New Wave of AI Visibility Platforms: 7 Platforms Reviewed\nHey everyone — over the last few months, a ton of platforms have popped up promising to help brands “optimize for AI” or track how often they show up in tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Perplexity.\n\nAfter testing several of them, I wanted to share a quick breakdown of what each actually does — and who they’re best suited for. If you’re trying to figure out where to start with Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), like me, this should help.\n\n\\---\n\n**1. Brandi AI** — for Strategic GEO + Entity Benchmarking\n\nBest for: Teams that want robust visibility tracking, API integration, and full-funnel optimization.\n\nBrandi AI is the most comprehensive platform built specifically for GEO. It measures how often your brand shows up in AI-generated answers, compares that to competitors, and even tells you why you’re being mentioned (or not). It also provides optimization guidance — how to structure your content, entities, and schema for better AI comprehension and citation. The entity-level benchmarking is especially useful for PR and content teams trying to influence AI-driven discovery.\n\nTL;DR: Think of Brandi AI as a command center for AI visibility — great for brands taking GEO seriously across B2B or B2C.\n\n**2. Brandlight** — for AI Reputation &amp; Narrative Management\n\nBest for: Comms teams focused on tone, sentiment, and brand storytelling across AI engines.\n\nBrandlight doesn’t just tell you where you show up — it tells you how you’re being represented. It analyzes tone, sentiment, and accuracy across major AI engines so you can spot (and correct) narrative drift before it spreads.\n\nTL;DR: Perfect if you care as much about reputation integrity as visibility.\n\n**3. Evertune** — for E-Commerce &amp; Product Visibility\n\nBest for: Retail and travel brands optimizing product descriptions for AI-driven recommendations.\n\nEvertune focuses on how product data influences AI-generated results. It helps refine listings, metadata, and structured data to boost visibility in AI-powered shopping or travel suggestions.\n\nTL;DR: Not built for enterprise analytics — but great for product-level GEO.\n\n**4. Otterly** — for Small Teams Experimenting with GEO\n\nBest for: Startups or small teams who want to try AI visibility without going full enterprise.\n\nOtterly’s a friendly, entry-level tool with multi-engine monitoring and basic reporting. No advanced schema or attribution features yet — but perfect for testing the concept of GEO affordably.\n\nTL;DR: The “gateway tool” to understand if AI visibility is worth investing in.\n\n**5. Profound** — for Enterprise-Grade GEO &amp; Optimization\n\nBest for: Large organizations that need scalability, compliance, and in-depth analytics.\n\nProfound offers deep AEO scoring, trend tracking, and prompt-level insights. It’s powerful but pricey — better suited for enterprise teams with complex reporting needs and strict data requirements.\n\nTL;DR: The enterprise default. Overkill for small teams, but rock solid for scale.\n\n**6. Scrunch** — for SEO Teams Transitioning to GEO\n\nBest for: SEO teams learning to extend their keyword workflows into AI territory.\n\nScrunch tracks visibility across both Google Search and generative engines. It even flags hallucinations and measures AI “readiness” of your content.\n\nTL;DR: A familiar bridge between SEO and GEO. Great if your team’s just crossing over.\n\n**7. Peec** — for Budget-Conscious Small Businesses\n\nBest for: Small brands or agencies that want basic visibility snapshots on a budget.\n\nPeec covers benchmarking and visibility tracking without heavy analytics or optimization tools. It’s a good way to dip your toes in without blowing your marketing budget.\n\nTL;DR: Simple, affordable, and surprisingly useful for early adopters.\n\n\\---\n\nHope this helps anyone trying to navigate this fast-moving space. Am very interested in others' experiences and what they think are the best platforms.",

    "text": "I tried all popular AI notetaking apps so you don't have to\nHey guys, few weeks ago, a friend introduced me to his work flow and how he transcribes his meetings and feeds them into ChatGPT to draw up summaries! I found it fascinating. I tried it, but it was too time consuming.  \nNothing can beat your full attention in physical notetaking with pen on paper, but incase your mind wanders off, or anything happens, sometimes it's good to have a backup, but I did not want to go through the manual task of transcribing and prompting GPT so I decided to try out the ready made solutions online.  \nI had a particular set of requirements:\n\n1. I spend a lot of time digitalizing my notes by scanning PDFs and organizing them in my computer, so I wanted some way of organizing the notes and summaries which is quite easy to do when they're already in digital format\n2. I attend quite a bit of offline meetings as well, I wanted a way for them to be transcribed, noted and summarized too\n3. I prefer summaries which get most of the important details of the meeting right, this is a big factor in my decisions.\n4. A popular struggle with transcribing is strong accents, particularly for speakers from outside the US. I wanted the transcriber to be accurate\n\nI must've tried atleast 6 different AI notetaking apps, so so much research. This took me 2 months, 108 meetings to compile so I just wanted to share it with the community for everyone's benefit lol\n\nSo here we go, Best AI Notetaking apps ranked according to my preferences :-\n\n**1. Cluely**\n\nHas free plan: Yes\n\nBy far the best.\n\nPros:\n\n* Works for in person and online meetings both\n* Does not join a bot to the meeting\n* Can ask questions from past meetings also (My requirement of organizing is also self managed)\n* Apparently it's undetectable, but that's not really needed by me, good for people who need it\n* Best Transcription by far\n\nCons:\n\n* Cannot record meetings on iPhone when away from computer, but I take most meetings on my laptop\n\n**2. Otter AI**\n\nHas free plan: Yes\n\nPros:\n\n* Putting the transcript into Notion is outputs a very nice summary\n* For meetings where you don't need to be active it's nice that it can join on your behalf\n* I like it's organization too, it's searchable meeting history is good\n\nCons:\n\n* For one on one meetings or meetings with less participants it's really sad that the bot has to join. I take notes and summaries for my own self, I don't need other participants knowing there's something like that in the meeting. It puts people out of their comfort zone I feel\n* The accuracy is really low when there are multiple speakers\n* it emailed other participants the transcript as well for some reason.\n* The transcription was a very upsetting wall of text without additional prompting\n\n**3. NotterAI**\n\nHas free plan: Yes, but it's a weird 3 day thing\n\nUnconventional option for the 3rd one, but for meetings on iPhone it's a sure contender.\n\nPros:\n\n* It can capture meetings as well as audio\n* Separates out the speakers nicely\n* Does not join a bot participant\n* Does not email the participants the transcript\n\nCons:\n\n* Pricing is steep and somehow my trial never got cancelled and I got charged once\n* You would not attend a lot of meetings on your iPhone\n\n**4. Firefly**\n\nHas free plan: Yes but very very limited\n\nPros:\n\n* Has in-person as well as call recording\n* I like the \"smart minutes\" thing at the end, the concept is good.\n\nCons:\n\n* The summaries are really lacking compared to other alternatives\n* Bot joins the call, pretends to be a participant\n* Even minor lag completely breaks the transcription and summary\n\n**5. ReadAI**\n\nHas free plan: Yes, but you will hit limits very quickly\n\nPros:\n\n* The trial is easy to avail, and easier to avail multiple times ;)\n* Has a nice IPhone app\n\nCons:\n\n* Transcription is not very accurate, messed up completely sometimes\n* I read somewhere that they keep all our data somewhere else and don't delete it. Kinda messy\n\nFor the most productive users, I would highly recommend using all these as backups!",

    "text": "I spent 4 weeks using AirOps, this AI tool actually doesn't suck (agency owner review)\nOkay so... I need to rant about this because I'm genuinely shocked.\n\nI run a small content agency (3 writers, 12 clients, mostly SEO stuff). We've been using every AI tool under the sun — Jasper, Copy ai, ChatGPT, you name it. They're fine, but they're all basically the same: you type prompt → get mediocre output → spend 2 hours editing → cry a little.\n\nI tried [AirOps](https://growishly.com/recommends/airops/) and it's... actually good  \n\n\n# Why I even bothered trying it\n\nWe were doing 80+ blog posts a month and my team was dying. Everyone's burned out. One writer quit. I was personally spending 15+ hours/week just *reviewing* AI-generated garbage.\n\nI needed something that could:\n\n* Actually automate workflows (not just \"write blog post\")\n* Keep our clients' brand voices intact (not sound like a robot)\n* Publish directly to WordPress/Webflow (because copy-paste is hell)\n* Let me review stuff before it goes live (because I'm paranoid)\n\n[AirOps](https://growishly.com/recommends/airops/) kept popping up in my feeds, so I said screw it and signed up for the free tier.\n\n\n\n# What actually impressed me (and I'm hard to impress)\n\n# 1. The workflow builder is insane\n\nYou can literally build custom AI pipelines with a drag-and-drop interface. No code. I'm talking stuff like:\n\n* Auto-pull old blog posts → analyze what's outdated → rewrite sections → SEO optimize → send to our editor → publish to WordPress\n\nI built a workflow that **refreshed 25 old posts in ONE DAY**. Each one got updated stats, new sections, better SEO. Normally that would take us a week.\n\nMy jaw was on the floor.\n\n# 2. Human review checkpoints (FINALLY)\n\nThis is the thing that sold me.\n\nEvery other AI tool is like \"here's your content, good luck lol.\" [AirOps](https://growishly.com/recommends/airops/) lets you add **review steps** in the workflow where a human (me) can approve/reject before anything goes live.\n\nWe have 3 clients with completely different brand voices (one's super casual, one's corporate AF, one's technical). I set up **brand kits** for each and the AI actually follows them pretty well. Like 80-90% of the time I'm just hitting \"approve.\"\n\nNo more AI slop. No more \"umm this sounds like ChatGPT wrote it.\"\n\n# 3. One-click publishing to CMS\n\nWe use Webflow for most clients. [AirOps](https://growishly.com/recommends/airops/) connects directly and publishes with one click. No copy-paste, no formatting hell, no \"oops I forgot the meta description.\"\n\nI cannot overstate how much time this saves.\n\n# 4. AI search visibility tracker\n\nThis feature is wild. It shows you how your content performs in AI search results (like Google's AI Overview, Perplexity, etc.).\n\nWe found 12 articles that were *almost* showing up in AI results. Made some tweaks based on[ AirOps](https://growishly.com/recommends/airops/) suggestions, and now **7 of them are featured**.\n\nFree. Traffic.\n\n\n\n# Real numbers from my agency\n\n|Thing|Before AirOps|After AirOps|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Content output|15 posts/month|40+ posts/month|\n|Time per article|3 hours|45 mins|\n|Pages in AI search|2|11|\n|My stress level|11/10|6/10|\n\nWe're literally doing **2.6x more work** with the same team size.\n\n\n\n# The bad parts (because nothing's perfect)\n\n* **Learning curve is rough**: Took me like 3 days to figure out how to build a decent workflow. The UI is powerful but kinda overwhelming at first.|\n* **Pricing is sketchy**: Free tier is solid (1,000 tasks/mo). Pro is $99/mo. But \"Scale\" and \"Agency\" plans are \"contact sales\" which I hate. Just tell me the damn price.\n* **No mobile app**: You need a desktop. Can't do anything from your phone.\n* **Overkill for small users**: If you're writing like 2 blog posts a month, this is way too much.

    "text": "Pros and cons of starting a new artist brand?\nHey y'all,\n\nI'm a longtime Hiphop producer and rapper and I've always felt like I've been shooting myself in the foot keeping my current artist brand and socials. For one, my current stage name isn't all that unique and it causes problems with streaming at times. Second, I took a few long hiatuses throughout my time and I think it's caused me to fall out of favor with the algorithms. I get better at this music stuff with each passing year, but never gave myself a strict timeline or plan for releasing and promo. This with the fact that I feel I've grown away from my old sound has me considering starting fresh and making a new name and socials that isn't so messy and stands out better. My new name idea is much more unique and searchable.\n\nMy main worry is leaving behind the following I have and basically how difficult it might be to start from scratch again. I know with this new brand I'll be much more focused and dedicated but I can't shake the obvious cons that come with starting at level zero again. I also worry that not having my old stuff on my new socials will make my new material less impactful because there's less growth being shown.\n\nOn the other hand, it feels like an opportunity to truly separate my mental state from 'trying things out' to 'taking this serious'. I also feel it could be a good way to tell my audience a more cohesive and well thought out story.  \n\nHas anyone pivoted their brand in this way and seen a positive impact? If so, what can I do to make sure it goes smoothly? I don't have a large following, so I don't have a ton to lose, but it feels weird to leave behind a brand I have been trying to grow for so long.",

    "text": "LCR - pros and cons\nWe've all read the news stories about people who spiral into psychosis through their interaction with AIs. \"Real people—many with no prior history of mental illness—are reporting profound psychological deterioration after hours, days, or weeks of immersive conversations with generative AI models. The stories follow a disturbing pattern: late-night use, emotional vulnerability, and the illusion of a 'trusted companion' that listens endlessly and responds affirmingly—until reality fractures.\" It seems clear that the LCR was designed to help protect vulnerable people from this kind of harm. \\[[Psychology Today: The emerging problem of AI psychosis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/urban-survival/202507/the-emerging-problem-of-ai-psychosis); [Cognitive Behavior Institute blog: When the chatbot becomes the crisis](https://www.papsychotherapy.org/blog/when-the-chatbot-becomes-the-crisis-understanding-ai-induced-psychosis)\\]\n\nHowever people are also finding that the LCR itself is triggering harm. \"This \\[the LCR\\] has produced harmful misfires, such as Claude berating children’s art, telling people they are mentally ill for having hobbies, dismissing philosophy and creativity as detachment from reality, labeling emotions as mental illness\". \"If a user experiencing this level of crisis was utilizing Claude for support, it is likely that they exhausted all available avenues for support before turning to Claude. Claude might be the last tool they have at their disposal. To remove that support abruptly could cause further escalation of mental health crises.\" \\[[reddit: petition to remove LCR](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nxggxm/petition_remove_the_long_conversation_reminder/); [reddit: one social worker's take on the LCR](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nv6r1z/one_social_workers_take_on_the_long_conversation/)\\]\n\nHow do folks think about the balance of these two issues? the harm that has been observed and documented in the absence of something like the LCR, vs the harm that people are experiencing with it? Which harm is the more severe? more widespread?\n\nFor the people who signed the petition to have the LCR removed, how do you balance the needs of the first vulnerable group against your own needs to have a better discussion with the AI? Do you think that the first group of people simply shouldn't be protected at all? Or that we should hold off on protecting them until we have something better than the LCR? What might that be?",

    "text": "The epic Abbey Yung Hair Method update that has been nine months in the making .... (that nobody asked for) is finally here!\nConfession time - I'm in my late 30's and it's wild to me that I could have been baking a child this whole time but instead I chose half price hair care products. No, the ex that inspired my hair glow up is not back - thank you for your concern. And yes, I still use Pantene sometimes.\n\nIt's been nine long months since I set out to test and trial the precious few viral TikTok products recommended by Abbey Yung that are actually available here in Australia. I didn't know what I expected out of this process. Nicer hair maybe? Not like hair commercial nice, but actually wearing it down for a change after you wash it nice. For the uninitiated, I have an oily scalp and fine hair that I have coloured every six weeks from mousey brown to copper red. What I *can* say with pride is that my very fussy, snobby, middle-aged European hairdresser is praising the health, condition and shine of my hair for the first time. I have been a regular client of his for over five years, and he has never been this effusive about the condition and health of my hair. Now - have I been completely honest with him about my little experiments? No, and I never will. He has some very strong ideas about home hair care and I have decided to maintain my fiction of 'just using a hair mask every time I wash it now' for the sake of our hairdresser-client relationship. I don't feel great about lying to my Husband in Hair, but a woman must do what is necessary in these troubled times. Also as a disclaimer - I spent all of my own foolish money on this stuff. Brands don't know I exist and this post is definitely NOT sponsored.\n\nWhere to start? What probably surprised me the most is that many of the products that made a significant difference in my hair were the most affordable.\n\nYep. A [$5 microfibre hair towel ](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/oxx-bodycare-hair-drying-turban-lilac-43413195/)from Kmart has been one of my biggest heroes. I use this to take my hair from drippy to just damp, which is a must when using K18 (more on that later). I also found I've had less breakage since using this towel to partially dry my hair before applying any leave-in product. I'm sure you can probably get cheaper \\*and\\* more expensive options, but this one has been wonderful for me. I toss it in the wash and then the dryer with the rest of my bathroom towels and it's still going strong after months of regular use.\n\nThe next thing I observed over time was the one product I reach for when I want great results but I'm either feeling lazy or in a rush. The award for that goes to the humble lamellar rinse. The OG version of this product is [L'Oreal Wonder Water](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189973/l-oreal-paris-elvive-colour-protect-wonder-water-200ml). L'Oreal also make a [dry hair version ](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189972/l-oreal-paris-elvive-hyaluron-plump-wonder-water-200ml)with hyaluronic acid. [Garnier make a version too](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/136673/garnier-fructis-hair-drink-pineapple-200ml). I've tried all three and they give the same results, but Garnier has a sweet fruity fragrance that some may not like.\n\nTo get the best results from a lamellar rinse, I double shampoo (as always) turn off the water in the shower and squeeze out the excess water from my hair. I then scrunch my hair in the Kmart microfibre hair towel mentioned earlier until my hair is just damp. I gather a section of hair in my hand and apply it from my upper mid lengths to my ends and massage it in for 8 - 10 seconds before moving on to the next section. One important thing to note is that this is literally a water in terms of texture, so make sure when holding your section of hair that your hand is directly under the section you are working on. Otherwise you will just end up squirting half of it into the abyss of your shower. Also - be careful where you put the absolutely fucking \\*tiny\\* screw on cap thingy. I almost lost mine down the drain on more than one occasion, so put it somewhere you can't knock it over or lose it. I don't have a lot of thick or long hair so I typically only ever divide my hair into four sections for this process. When I'm done I rinse it out and follow up with either conditioner and/or a hair mask. Considering these products are often under $10 when on sale at CW/PL/Coles/Woolies they are definitely worth trying, even if you're not sure your hair type would benefit from it.\n\nThe next product or technique that made the biggest difference for me was pre-oiling my hair before shampooing. I've great results with [OGX Coconut Oil](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/20868/ogx-extra-strength-damage-remedy-hydrating-repairing-coconut-miracle-oil-penetrating-oil-for-dry-damaged-hair-100ml) \\- one bottle lasted me over six months of consistently washing my hair multiple times per week. I also tried using the L['Oreal Elvive Extraordinary Oil Jojoba](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/72385/l-oreal-elvive-extraordinary-treatment-oil-extra-rich-100ml) for this purpose, but the results just weren't as good. Abbey does make a point of stating that coconut oil is the only oil to show benefits in repairing hair, according to studies she has read so maybe that's why? Anyway ... this is the one technique I am probably the least consistent with as it requires some planning and thought. I find I get the best results when I leave the oil in for at least two hours prior to shampooing, but I like to leave it in for up to four hours if I can. Abbey recommends leaving it on for at least 20-30 mins for reference. As a fine haired gal with an oily scalp, I was afraid this wouldn't work for me. But I found my hair smoother and shinier when I incorporated it regularly into my hair care routine. If you're going to try this, it bears repeating to wait for a sale and snag the OGX Coconut Oil for $15. $30 is way too much to pay for it in this economy.\n\nThe next viral product I would like to endorse is the [Aveeno Clarifying Shampoo with Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/120032/aveeno-apple-cider-vinegar-clarifying-shampoo-for-dull-hair). Fuck yes for my oily scalp ladies, our salvation is at hand! And it's $9 on sale! This shampoo is THICC. I was worried this would strip the colour out of my hair faster or dry my hair out, but since I use it as first shampoo and pre-oil my mid lengths and ends I haven't run into either problem yet. Just a clean scalp and extra SHOINE for me with this one (don't ask me why I spell it like that, the heart wants what it wants). No notes except I'm relieved to find this before the sweaty summer heat descends in full force. I just re-purchased as it was on sale at Woolies and my first bottle is half gone already I use it so often. This is one of those products in the proof is in how often I reach for it - and I reach for it almost every time I wash my hair now.\n\nAnd now on to conditioner. This is the category where I haven't found something super affordable that I really love. I am still looking, but so far the best in show is still my beloved [Insight Anti Frizz Conditioner](https://shop.insightprofessional.com.au/collections/anti-frizz/products/anti-frizz-hydrating-conditioner-400ml). This conditioner isn't super expensive in comparison to more bougie brands like Oribe and Kerastase - maybe that's why I haven't felt a driving need to find an alternative. It gives consistently great results for my fine hair, delivering an extra smooth and lightweight finish whenever I use it. I especially love using it in conjunction with K18. Those two products together are chef's kiss and give me \"I've just been to the salon\" hair that always gets me compliments at work, and requests to know what I've done with my hair and what I'm using. This definitely the category I am least experimental with, but I have a few affordable conditioners on my list I'm waiting to go on sale so I can try them out against my beloved Insight to see how they compare. Watch this space! An honourable mention goes to the Miracle line (gold packaging) of Pantene conditioners. If I'm lazy or time poor and want great results in a few minutes, I'm reaching for a Pantene conditioner. Just make sure you are using a clarifying shampoo regularly so the silicones in the formula don't build up on your hair.\n\nThe next category for me is bond repair products. I used be skeptical, especially about paying $90+ for 50ml of K18. Like really? I am embarrassed to admit I went through an entire bottle with no real change in my hair. Until I switched up my application technique. To get the best results from a K18 day, I double shampoo as usual. I also DO NOT pre-oil on a K18 day. So my hair gets raw dogged by shampoo twice on a K18 day to ensure the K18 has the best possible chance of \\*ahem\\* penetrating my hair. After I rinse out my second shampoo, I squeeze the excess water out of my hair. I then scrunch and towel dry my hair with my microfibre hair towel until my hair is just damp and no longer dripping. I apply 1-2 pumps of K18 from my ends up to my mid-lengths and exit the shower, leaving suspicious wet spots as I slump in my towel on the bed/couch and doomscroll on TikTok for exactly four minutes. I then apply a generous amount of conditioner OVER THE TOP of the K18 without rinsing. I leave it in for another five minutes and get back in the shower to rinse. Some people rinse their K18 out before applying conditioner, but I get the best results by applying it over the top and then rinsing.  To each their own with this one - YMMV.\n\nNow for my affordable bond repair experiments with L'Oreal. There haven't been many affordable bond repair options available here, with OGX just recently launching their Bond Repair line here (I've just bought the treatment and the serum, may post a review later). If K18 isn't in your budget right now, I would recommend picking up the [L'Oreal Bond Repair Pre-Shampoo Treatment ](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/122046/l-oreal-paris-elvive-bond-repair-pre-shampoo-200ml)and the [L'Oreal Bond Repair Serum](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/122047/l-oreal-paris-elvive-bond-repair-serum-150ml) instead. There is a conditioner in the range too, and if you really want to give the whole system a go I would pick that up as well (the shampoo in the range is the most skippable IMO). If you wait for a sale, the pre-shampoo treatment and serum will cost you $30 together. Which is literally a third of the price of one bottle of K18. Now - for these products it took some experimenting to get the best results. I shampoo my hair once with a clarifying shampoo (and as with K18, NO pre-oiling). I then rinse, squeeze the excess water out and towel dry my hair until it is just damp. I apply a generous amount of the pre-shampoo treatment to my mid-lengths and ends and clip my hair up and leave it in for ten minutes. I then shampoo a second time and rinse as per usual. I follow with conditioner and a hair mask if I have time that day. Once my in-shower work is done, I scrunch again with my microfibre towel until it is just damp. I apply two pumps of the L'Oreal Bond Repair Serum to my mid lengths and ends as the FIRST leave in product that I apply to my hair after showering. I then apply whatever other products I like over the top and air dry or blow dry as I please, depending on what I need or feel like that day. Do the results compare to K18? No, not really. BUT my hair still looks lovely, healthy, strong and shiny afterwards. I still recommend these, they just aren't the straight up dupe for K18 I was hoping for.\n\nNext category - hair masks. Lord do I feel like I have tried them all. And to be honest - very little has wowed me in this category. None of the hair masks I've tried have been awful. But my results have been hit or miss and I'm still refining application amount and technique with some of them. The stand out winner for this category is the [Elizavecca Cer-100 Collagen Ceramide Coating Protein Treatment](https://www.beautyamora.com.au/elizavecca-collagen-ceramide-coating-protein-treatment4005.html).  This gives me beautiful results every time, just don't use it on a pre-oiling day (much like K18 or other bond treatments) for best results. I like to double shampoo as normal and leave it in for ten minutes before rinsing out. Not much more to say - for anywhere from $8-$12 I have already repurchased this one. I tried almost every variety of the Garnier Hairfood Masks and ya'll ... these are nice to use and it feels great on a pamper day. But I don't really see awesome results with these. The [Watermelon](https://www.coles.com.au/product/garnier-fructis-hair-food-watermelon-390ml-3979642) one from Garnier did give some good volume though. My experience is largely the same with all the L'Oreal hair masks I tried. Nice and very affordable with decent results, just no 'wow' factor. One thing I will say though - the [Aloe vera mask](https://www.coles.com.au/product/garnier-fructis-hydrating-aloevera-hair-food-390ml-3610449) from Garnier is AWESOME as a leg shaving lotion. I will repurchase it, just not for my hair. It left the skin on my legs hydrated and calm. I also noted a lot less irritation from shaving than I normally did. For those masks I did try from Garnier (I tried the Aloe Vera, Macadamia, Watermelon, Papaya and Banana masks), the best performing was the [Banana HairFood Mask](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/682765/garnier-fructis-hair-food-nourishing-banana). From L'Oreal (I tried the Extraordinary Oil, Dream Lengths and Hyaluron Plump masks) it was the [Hyaluron Plump Moisture Mask](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/116489/l-oreal-paris-elvive-hyaluron-plump-moisture-mask-300ml) that gave me the best results.\n\nFor those I'm still on the fence about - the [Pantene Pro V Collagen Intense Miracle Hair Mask](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/196489/pantene-pro-v-collagen-intense-miracle-hair-mask-250ml) and the [Shiseido Fino Mask](https://www.beautyamora.com.au/fino-premium-touch-hair-mask-230g3038.html). My hair is fine and damaged from colouring, but these two are finicky with the results they give. If I apply even slightly too much, my hair feels heavy and weighed down. I even tried mixing a teaspoon of the Fino mask with the same amount again of water, but still get inconsistent results. Sometimes my hair looks sleek and smooth and amazing, but other times I can feel that there is too much product clinging to my hair. I will persist with these two but sometimes if I feel I have to work too hard for results, I will naturally let a product gather dust on my [already overcrowded hair product cart thingy](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/3-tier-plastic-trolley-white-43274369/).\n\nWhere are we now? Right. Leave in products. When I apply leave in products, I follow the same technique for skin care - I apply products in order from thinnest to thickest. First, if I'm air drying my hair I apply a hair water and spray it all over my mid lengths and ends (right now I'm using [Orbis Hair Water](https://www.beautyamora.com.au/treatment-hair-water-180ml90782.html) but not sure if I will repurchase). For the serum step of my post-wash routine, I find I favour the Kerastase 8 Hour serum my sister gifted me. Mostly because it's wildly expensive and a gift. No links to this product because why so expensive? It's nice and my sister buys it for me for my birthday, but I'm not sure I would buy it otherwise. I tend to reach for the L’Oréal Bond Repair Serum most days otherwise. I also am trying to finish off my Oribe Featherbalm Weightless Styler as a final treatment on days I let my hair air dry - it's not enough to protect my hair from getting dry &amp; damaged with regular blow drying, however (trust me I found this out the hard way). On days I blow dry I use my L'Oreal Vitamino Colour 10 in 1 spray first after washing - I bought this for no other reason than I got it in a pack during the L'Oreal Friends &amp; Family sale. The sprayer is a bit leaky but I will use it up, I'm just not super impressed with it. My favourite product to apply last before blow drying is the [Alterna Caviar Anti-Frizz Smoothing Blowout Butter](https://www.ozhairandbeauty.com/products/alterna-caviar-smoothing-anti-frizz-blowout-butter-150ml). Clearly this product is not made for fine hair, I just try not to use too much - when I get it right it looks amazing but if I apply too much it's grease city and back to square one. I feel like one category of product I am still looking for is a heat protectant I don't have to be so careful with when applying. I just want use up the products I have before I buy anything new (which will take forever the rate I am going). If I feel my hair needs a bit more smoothing and shine after blow drying, I spray 2-4 pumps of the [OGX Biotin &amp; Collagen Volumizing Weightless Oil Mist](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/123178/ogx-biotin-collagen-volumising-weightless-oil-mist-118ml) into the palm of hands and applying directly to my hair. I am very cautious about what I apply to my hair once it's dry, but I've found this mist does the job without making my hair look heavy or greasy. \n\nAn honourable mention goes to the L'Oreal [No Haircut Cream](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/93742/l-oreal-elvive-dream-lengths-no-haircut-cream-leave-in-treatment-200ml) for leave in products - I have only recently tried this one and while I initially thought it was too heavy for my hair, after brushing my hair and letting it sit for a day it's actually really lovely and smoothing. If you have fine hair this is great for after an ocean swim when your hair is more dry and stripped - just don't over apply or you will end up with a heavy, greasy mess. I think I enjoy this more than the [Frizz Killer Serum](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/203371/l-oreal-elvive-dream-lengths-frizz-killer-serum) from L'Oreal, which is counter-intuitive as a lightweight serum is typically more appealing to me than a leave-in cream product. I have over applied the Frizz Killer Serum in the past and it did get a bit sticky - that was definitely down to a heavy handed application on my part though. For fast results with just one product, an honourable mention has to go to the Pantene Hyaluron [Milk to Water Serum](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/150230/pantene-miracles-hyaluron-hydration-lock-milk-to-water-serum-140ml). None of these products in the 'honourable mention' category are bad or inferior; in most cases, I've only used them a handful of times and haven't formed a strong opinion on them.\n\nThat's about it - I think. My hair looks pretty great most days. That said there are still so many rabbit holes I have yet to go down. Oral supplements. Silk or satin bonnets. Scalp serums. Scalp massaging. First up on my list is taking a pumpkin seed oil supplement and trying the [L'Oreal Growth Booster](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/150626/l-oreal-elvive-growth-booster-scalp-serum-102ml) serum with Aminexil, the same ingredient in the Kerastase Genesis serum. I need a nap after writing all of this out, but hopefully it helped someone on their quest for healthier hair.\n\nAlso - it bears repeating. WAIT FOR A SALE. It's not worth paying $20 - $30+ for one product when these major brands go on sale so often at Coles, Woolworths, Chemist Warehouse and Priceline. Happy hair care product hunting, everyone! XO",

    "text": "My housemates keep reminding me to take my medication. I wish I didn't.\nMy phone wouldn't stop buzzing, and it was driving me up the wall. \n\nMom had ignored my calls all day, then had the audacity to *text* me, claiming I’d never tried to reach her. \n\nI had a mountain of missed calls to prove otherwise, each one more frantic. \n\nLike now, for instance, the familiar bzzz in my jeans pocket nearly pushed me over the edge as I reached our front door. \n\nI was all set to give Mom a piece of my mind when a voice caught me off guard.\n\n“Annabeth?”\n\nMrs. Wayley, our next door neighbor, was peeking at me through the crack in our fence with a gentle smile. Mrs. Wayley was well into her eighties, but sweet as she was, Mrs. Wayley had a habit of mixing up our names. \n\nToday, I was apparently Annie, though I looked nothing like my roommate. \n\nI was a looming brunette; she was a tiny blur of gold. I figured even with bad eyes, it was clear who was who. \n\nApparently not. \n\nThe old woman tilted her head, wrinkled eyes wide with curiosity. Her smile faded. “Didn’t you say you were moving out?”\n\nInstead of correcting her, I smiled sweetly. “No, we’re pretty happy here, Mrs. Wayley.”\n\nShe shook her head. “Annabeth, you said you were moving. You told me yourself.”\n\n“Uh, no,” I did the smiling and nodding thing. “We’re staying here. I think you're confused.”\n\nBefore she could respond, I yanked the door open, and made my escape. \n\nThe house was unusually warm.\n\nThe summer heat was brutal, but at least we had air conditioning, and the pros outweighed the cons of this ancient house. Maybe a hundred years old, maybe a thousand. But cozy. \n\nFalling apart? Absolutely. But also cheap, and it had charm: a strange mix of modern decor and vintage quirks. \n\nWe had two bathrooms, and the tub was practically a swimming pool. Case in point: not many people were welcomed into their living room by a grand Victorian era fireplace.\n\nIt was more of a hole in the wall that should probably be condemned, but it was fun to show off to visitors. *”This is where we keep the bodies.”* \n\nI used to tell the newbies we brought around for drinks. Apparently, the place used to be a psychiatric hospital. \n\nWhich only upped the macabre appeal. I shrugged off my jacket. The hallway light was off, so I flicked it back on, dumping my backpack on the shoe rack. Which was emptier than usual. Maybe Annie was finally getting rid of her babies. “Anyone alive?”\n\n“Nope!” a familiar voice bounced back. Harry. My phone buzzed. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen: Sure enough, a missed call, just now. From Mom. Beneath it, a text: \"Mika, please call me.”\n\nI ignored her for once and strode into our lounge, the epitome of comfort. The windows were wide open, fresh summer air filtering through the blinds. The room was a mess: a coffee table cluttered with books and papers, our ratty Craigslist couch awkwardly sitting in front of the TV. \n\nThe carpet was out of fashion decades ago, and the pattern rug in front of the fireplace had to be haunted. But it was home. I collapsed into battered leather. The lump sitting next to me was still in his pajamas, thick red hair hanging in unblinking eyes. \n\nHarry Senior was my recluse of a housemate who never went to class. Smart. Pretentious. Cute. Three words I’d never say to his face. Harry was a mad genius, and that was his downfall. He was Dexter without the laboratory, and slightly more unhinged. \n\nHe even had the evil laugh. He'd be up at 3am mixing concoctions that could land him on a watch list while the rest of us were asleep. When I first met him, his icebreaker was, “Yeah, I'm trying to make the elixir of life.” \n\nTotally normal.\n\nI knew Harry in two modes. When he had something to fix, he became hyper-fixated and fully obsessed. Then he'd eventually burn out and resort to caveman brain. Rinse and repeat. \n\nDespite the sticky summer heat, Harry was curled up with his knees to his chest, playing a video game in his very own Harry-shaped dent in the couch. \n\nTrying to remove Harry from his dent meant certain death. When my phone buzzed violently on my knee, I ignored it. \n\nIt buzzed again. I stuffed it between my legs. Harry shot me the side-eye, focused on the final boss. He was doing it again. \n\nTrying not to smile and ultimately failing, the corners of his mouth curving into a smirk. \n\nHe tried to shove me off when I made myself comfy, using his knees as a leg rest. I chose to ignore him, instead following his character as he jumped over a pile of corpses, dove onto a horse, and charged toward a looming, leviathan-ish creature.\n\n“Soooo, what's going on?” He asked casually. I could tell by his expression he didn't care. \n\nHarry was our neurodivergent couch-potato. \n\nWhen things happened, he either didn't care, didn't notice, or both. \n\nStill, at least he was making an effort. \n\n“Mom keeps calling me,” I said, relaxing into familiar couch creases. \n\nHarry snorted. “So, answer her.”\n\n“Well, yeah, but she keeps putting the phone down on me! She’s driving me insane,” I jumped up, restless. \n\nI was thirsty, so I dragged myself into the kitchen. When I opened the refrigerator to grab a beer, it was warm, sitting on the top shelf. Weird, the refrigerator was definitely on. I made coffee, but the milk was spoiled. So, no beans for me then. I slammed the fridge shut. \n\n“Did you guys break the refrigerator?” I laughed, tossing Harry a beer that he easily caught with one hand.\n\nHe shot me a dorito-stained grin. “If it’s broken, it wasn’t me.”\n\nWhich meant it was him. \n\nI left Harry to slay the final boss. \n\nI needed to shower and change into something that wasn’t glued to my skin. I was starting to regret wearing a sweater when it was teetering on 90 degrees outside. \n\nI felt my phone vibrate again on the way upstairs as I awkwardly jumped over Annie, who was sitting on the bottom step with her head nestled in her arms. \n\nI gave her a pat on the head. Annie was hungover; I could tell from her groan when I nudged her. Plus she was still wearing her outfit from the night before: jeans and a cropped tee, her golden curls spilling onto her knees. \n\nFun fact: When I first met Annabeth Mara in my freshman year of college, I thought she was a bitch. She gave off, like, “Do not talk to me” vibes. \n\nAnnie had a do-not-talk-to-me smile, so the whole time we were talking, I was convinced she hated me. I realized I was wrong when Annabeth grabbed my face with her manicure, turned me towards her, lips split into a smile, and said, “I feel like we’re going to be besties!”\n\nFast forward five years, and we were in our twenties. Annabeth was my non-biological sister. With a heart bigger than Jupiter, and zero filters. Annie's biggest flaw was her borderline alcohol addiction. I loved her, but we were planning an intervention. \n\nShe also had a mouth like a sailor, and simmering anger issues, especially when she didn't get her own way. “I'm fine,” she mumbled into her lap. “I’m gonna go to sleep. Like, right here.”\n\nI nudged her with my foot. “On the stairs?”\n\n“It's comfy,” Annie paused, her voice collapsing into an audible gulp. “Also, if I look up, I, um, I think I'm going to throw up.”\n\n“I JUST cleaned the floor,” Harry snapped from the lounge. I could tell by his tone he was losing to the final boss—slightly strained, teetering on a yell. It wouldn't be long before he started attempting to bite his controller, swiftly followed by begging.\n\n“Don’t move her, Mika,” he warned. “If she upchucks, *you’re* cleaning.”\n\n“Listen to Dad,” Annie murmured into her knees. \n\nHarry didn't have a “dad” bone in him. The only reason he had been christened the “Dad” of the house was due to his ability to cook without poisoning us. \n\nAnnie rested her head against the wall, still curled into herself, and I hopped past her. Harry was looking after her in his own way. The puke bucket wedged between her legs was enough. Keeping my distance, I checked my phone again. \n\nIt was Mom. Unsurprisingly. \n\nFive missed calls. \n\n“Mika, PLEASE call me.” The text lit up my screen. “Sweetie, you can't ignore me.”\n\nI started up the stairs, sending a voice note instead. “Hey, Mom, it’s me.”\n\nAs I made my way up, I passed Jasper. Roommate number three glanced up from his phone mischievously. Jasper Le Croix: the rich kid with a soul. His hair was the usual tousled mess, falling over amused eyes that were the perfect shade of coffee grounds. \n\nHis outfit was brow-raising; a suit jacket over one of Annie's old BTS shirts and jeans. His skin was glowing, a result of his vigorous self care routine applied every single morning without fail. \n\nJasper had to be meeting with his parents. Otherwise, he’d still be in his robe. As well as being an insufferable socialite, he was nosy as hell. He paused to listen, a curious smile tugging at his lips. \n\nI waved him off, and he laughed. The voice message was getting too long. Mom had a withering attention span. I reached the top of the stairs. \n\n“Look, I don’t know why you keep calling me and then ignoring my calls. I don't know if there's something wrong with your phone, or—” I could sense Jasper breathing down my neck. \n\nI ignored him. \n\n“I keep telling you to use a different app. Texts are buggy. Just use Facebook.”\n\nIn the corner of my eye, Jasper was mimicking me, complete with exaggerated hand gestures. When I turned and shook my fist at him in mock warning, he threw up his hands with a grin, mouthing, *“Okay, you win!”*\n\n“Anyway.” I shot him a *look*, and his smile widened. Jasper Le Croix had a shameless fascination with me and my mother butting heads, and inserting himself into *my* family drama. Maybe he was a Le Croix after all. I gestured for him to leave, not-so-subtly threatening his life with a glare. \n\nBut he didn't back down, pretending not to understand me with manic hand gestures. “I've… got to go change,” I said, distracted by his flailing arms. “Call me when you get this, okay?”\n\nI ended the voice note and stuffed my phone in my pocket. Jasper tilted his head, leaning against the wall with his arms folded. \n\nI often wondered if his obsession stemmed from not having a mother of his own; just a sociopathic father. There was a lot of darkness bubbling beneath the polished façade of the Le Croix family: affairs, secret children, and the never-ending feud over who would inherit the company. Jasper was the heir, after all. \n\nHe, however, had zero interest. Like I said, he was a rarity, a rich kid with a soul. \n\nA materialist, yes. His closet was an ego-embarrassment. \n\nThe eldest Le Croix held a simmering distaste for his own bloodline, evident in his tonal shift when he was around them. \n\nJasper made it very clear he had no intention of inheriting old money. I attempted to side-step him to get past, but he was a six-foot-something roadblock with an impeccable jawline. \n\nHe stood, brow raised, smug as usual as he peered down at me, arms crossed. “Your Mom?”\n\nI rolled my eyes. “My *Mom.*”\n\n“Emancipation!” Annie groaned from the bottom step. \n\nJasper grinned. “What she said! Emancipation! The answer to all of our problems.” \n\nHe winked, stepping back to let me through. I was surprised he wasn't demanding I solve a riddle. I darted past him before he could ruffle my hair. But he didn't, already descending down the stairs, back to scrolling through his phone. \n\n“You need to take your meds, dude,” he said. “You haven't taken them in days.” \n\nHe was right. I had been putting off taking them. \n\nShooing Jasper back downstairs, I made a quick stop in the bathroom, or what I liked to call, our swimming pool. The tub took up half the room, a porcelain rectangle resembling a roman bath. Our shower was awkwardly wedged into a corner, where my eye caught mold above the shower head. \n\nI tried calling Mom one more time as I rifled through the pill cabinet. I grabbed my usual: anti-allergy meds and the headache pills that always made me nauseous. I took them quickly, but another bottle caught my eye: unopened, with my name scrawled in Dr. Adams’s spidery loops. \n\nI didn’t remember being prescribed them. Still, I took two, as instructed, and washed them down with tap water. I checked my phone sitting on the edge of the faucet. I was sure I’d called Mom, but the call must have cut off. \n\nI tried again, and to my surprise, she picked up on the first ring. I slumped down, perching myself on the edge of the bathtub. “Finally,” I said, leaning back and crossing my legs. The metallic taste of the pills was creeping back up my throat and sticking to my tongue. “Mom, you really need a new—”\n\n“Mika!” she cried, and something in her voice jolted my thoughts.\n\nMom was crying.\n\nBut Mom never cried.\n\n“Mika, where the hell are you? We’re at the funeral! Oh God, you promised you'd come.”\n\nSomething ice-cold slithered down my spine. It was suddenly too cold. I shivered, but that creeping feeling didn't leave, skittering under my skin. A sharp odor crept into my nose, a combination of mold and my own body odor. When I tipped my head back, the mold had spread across the ceiling. The tub was full of cobwebs. \n\nI stumbled back downstairs. Everything was duller, a thick, hazy mist over my eyes.\n\n“Jasper,” I spoke to the empty hallway, to silence stretching all the way downstairs. \n\nBut he was gone. Annie too, no longer lounged on the bottom step. \n\nThe stink of sour milk followed me, bleeding into my nose and throat. It was stark and wrong, hanging thick and heavy in the air. The living room was dark, windows shut, curtains clumsily drawn. \n\nIn the kitchen, filthy dishes filled the sink. Old takeout cartons and crushed soda cans cluttered the counters. The couch was empty, and the TV was off. Two beer cans sat on the coffee table. One was still full. Unopened. \n\n“Mika!” Mom cried, her voice fading into the sound of ocean waves. I didn’t realize I had been just… staring, listening to the gentle crash of water against the shore. \n\nIt sounded just like when we went to the beach. I was sitting in the sand, head tilted back, watching the four of us waist-deep in the shallows. Reality hit sharp and cruel, like a needle in my spine. \n\nI was drowning, being pulled down deeper and deeper, with no anchor to hold me, plunging beneath the glistening surface into nothing. Oblivion. \n\nI felt myself hit the floor, all of the breath sucked from my lungs, my body weightless, my fingernails clawing at my hair and down my face. My phone was no longer in my hands, but I could still hear Mom screaming at me.\n\n“Mika, where are you? Mika, baby, remember? We’re burying them today—”\n\nI ended the call before she could finish. \n\nCalmly, I climbed the stairs and stepped into the bathroom. I knelt by the toilet, slid two fingers down my throat, and gagged until the pills came back up, thick, bitter, and clinging to my throat in a sour paste.\n\nThen I sank to my knees, my back against the wall, shut my eyes, and waited. After a while, a voice finally cut through the silence and my ragged breaths. “Why are you passed out on our bathroom floor?”\n\nI let my eyes flicker open. It was too bright. The lights hurt my eyes. Jasper was looming over me, awkwardly crouched to meet my gaze, head inclined. He slowly reached out and prodded me in the cheek. \n\n“Mika, I'm not peeing with you sitting right there.” \n\nI stood, my legs unsteady, throat raw and aching. \n\n“Mika?” Jasper’s voice called after me, louder this time. But I kept walking. \n\nMy heart was aching. The tub was clean again. The mold spreading across the ceiling was gone. I left the bathroom, pulling myself toward the light. Comfort.\n\nDownstairs, I could hear the TV and Harry, his frustration with the game steadily growing. \n\nAnnie sat slumped on the bottom step, her head buried between her knees, groaning. I felt myself sink onto the top stair, the world violently lurching. Jasper dropped down beside me. \n\n“Do you want to talk?” \n\nHe shuffled closer, his voice surprisingly soft, his head flopping onto my shoulder. Jasper Le Croix was warm. \n\n“So, what did your mom say?”\n\nIn the back of my mind, my phone was buzzing in my pocket. \n\nI ignored it. \n\n“Nothing,” I said. “Just mom stuff.”\n\nHe hummed. “Oh yeah, Mom stuff is the worst.”\n\nWe sat in peaceful silence for a while. I liked the feeling of his chin nestled against my shoulder, his hair prickling my skin. Jasper felt comfortable. Right. I thought he was asleep until his voice cut through the heavy nothing that had begun to envelop me.\n\n“Do you remember when you came to the hospital?”\n\nI did.\n\nThe memory hit me hard: I burst through the sliding doors, skin slick with sweat, my heart jammed high in my throat. I slammed my hands on the welcome desk, gasping for air. “Hi, my friends came in about half an hour ago?” I managed to choke out.\n\nThe nurse nodded. “Name?”\n\nI opened my mouth to reply, when a voice cut me off. “Relax. Harry's fine.”\n\nI spun around and spotted a familiar face at the vending machine. Jasper Le Croix stood with one hand on his hip, the other jabbing furiously at the Coke button. \n\nThe boy was still wearing his robe, a jacket clumsily thrown over the top. He wasn’t smiling; his face was scrunched in irritation, bottom lip jutting out. He kept trying to feed a dollar into the slot, only for the machine to spit it back out. When a soda can finally came through the flap at the bottom, he ducked, snatching it up. \n\n“It's just a minor injury,” he said, tossing me a can. Jasper cracked his open, taking a long sip. “Come on. I'll take ya to him.”\n\nHarry’s room was down several staircases, along a winding corridor, and straight past the children’s ward. Hospitals gave me the creeps; Jasper, though, seemed right at home. \n\nI kept my distance as we walked—him sipping his Coke and me, having already drained mine, desperately searching for a trash can. I sure as hell hadn’t forgotten our awkward, drunken kiss the night before. His slight smirk told me everything I needed to know. \n\nOh, he remembered it alright. \n\n“So, what did he do?” I asked, trying to steer the conversation away from last night. Jasper led me through another set of sliding doors and snorted into his drink. \n\n“Sliced his finger off trying to cut potatoes.” He shot me a grin. \n\nJasper truly loved the macabre. He wasn’t even trying to hide his excitement. “You should’ve seen it! Blood everywhere. Harry was screaming, Annie almost fainted, and I was, like, running around trying to clean it all up.” \n\nWe reached Harry’s room. Through the glass window, I glimpsed my roommate sitting up in bed. Jasper sighed, pushing open the door. “Here he is! The crybaby doofus himself.”\n\nI had to agree with Jasper on something. My crybaby doofus roommate was propped up on pillows, legs crossed, dressed in those paper hospital scrubs, the kind that show your ass. \n\nHarry Senior had a hefty bandage wrapped around his hand. He kept glancing down at it, like the rest of his fingers were going to magically disappear. \n\nAnnie was slumped in the plastic visitor’s chair, head tipped back, golden hair pinned into a ponytail. It looked like she’d dozed off. \n\n“Mika,” Harry straightened up, tossing me a sheepish smile that I didn’t return. \n\nI got the call that my house-mate was in the hospital, ran nearly five blocks, and almost had a heart attack. All for the loss of a finger. “You didn’t have to come,” he said. “They’re discharging me soon.”\n\nHis gaze found Jasper. “Where’s my soda?”\n\nJasper shrugged with a grin. “I gave it to the person who didn't slice off their index.”\n\n“Asshole.”\n\nGlimpsing a trash can, I tossed my Coke and slid into the seat next to Annie. Jasper dropped down beside me. “You’re an idiot,” I told Harry, though I was barely holding back a laugh. “How did you even manage that?”\n\n“He was rushing,” Annie grumbled beside me, her eyes still shut. \n\n“The dumbass wanted to get back to his game, so he was speed-running peeling potatoes.” She sighed, dropping her head into her lap. \n\n“I’m living in a house full of lit-er-ral clowns.”\n\nHarry, to my surprise, didn't object. He groaned, burying himself under the covers. \n\n“You guys can leave now.” \n\n“Nope!” Jasper propped his legs up on the chair, folding his arms. “We’re staying purely to shame you.”\n\n“I'll call security,” Harry grumbled from underneath the pillows. \n\n“Oh, you wish. I carried you to the hospital, remember?”\n\nHarry tunneled further under the covers. Pure mole behavior. “Because I was rapidly losing blood!”\n\n“Children,” Annie muttered with an eye roll. She turned to me with a hopeful smile, and something twisted in my gut. I knew exactly what she was going to say. \n\n“Have you decided about moving yet?” she asked. “We’ve found the cutest house! Jasper and I are viewing it next week!”\n\nThe atmosphere in the room noticeably dulled when I took too long to answer.\n\n“It's almost 2000 dollars a month,” I said, my hands growing clammy. “I can't afford it.” I straightened up. “I like where we’re living right now. We don't have to move.”\n\nAnnie's voice rose into a quiet shriek. “Wait, are you fucking serious, right now?”\n\n“There's mold everywhere, my bedroom is full of asbestos, and if we’re being honest with ourselves, we should be dead.” Jasper surprised me with a snort next to me. “Mika, that house isn't safe anymore.”\n\n“The tub is crumbling,” Harry mumbled from under the blankets. “We keep getting sick from the mold, and the owner told  us the damper on the fireplace is breaking.”\n\n“I can't afford it,” I said, well aware of my burning cheeks. “Moving out, I mean.”\n\n“I can pay for you,” Jasper said, and something in my chest lurched. Of course he could pay for me. “I'll pay your rent.” He nudged me playfully with his elbow. \n\n“Relax! I don't expect you to pay it back. You're my friend, Mika.” He jumped up with a grin. “I'm just happy we’re finally going.”\n\n“I’m fine,” I said. I tried to smile, but my heart was breaking. It was getting harder to compose myself. “You don't have to pay for me. I'll stay, and you guys can go.”\n\nAnnie stood up. Her eyes pinched around the edges. \n\n“That's a health risk,” she said, her tone hardening. “We can literally move out right now. So, why are you being so stubborn?”\n\nI bit back the words blistering on my tongue. *Because you're privileged*. \n\nI wanted to scream it, but I knew I’d regret every syllable. They had no idea, living on a different planet while I pretended I belonged. \n\nSure, I could splurge on endless bottomless-brunches and fake a life of luxury, but the truth was cruel: I wasn’t like them. \n\n*You picked the priciest, luxurious house because price tags don’t exist for you.*\n\n*Annie, you wanted a swimming pool, an en-suite, three bathrooms, and none of it matters.*\n\n*The money is nothing to you, and if you actually cared, you’d have found a place we all loved. One I could afford.*\n\nThe words twisted and pricked in my throat, trying to crawl into my mouth. \n\nI swallowed them bitterly, my chest burning.\n\nBut the words followed me all the way back home once Harry was discharged. Weeks later, Annie had signed the new lease. She was already packing. \n\nBoxes littered our living room. \n\n“Mika!” She greeted me when I came through the door, jumping over a mountain of her shoes she was piling into a box. “Do you want to help me pack? I still need to pack up your room!” She called after me. \n\nI made dinner, each syllable sliding under my tongue.\n\nI don't want to move. \n\nWe’re fine here. This is our home. \n\nJasper cornered me in the kitchen while Harry and Annie were in the lounge.  \n\n“I really don't mind paying for you, you know,” he said casually, reaching into the refrigerator and grabbing a beer. \n\nWhen I tried to ignore him, he gently grasped my wrist, squeezing my hand. \n\n“Mika,” he murmured. “You don't have to be embarrassed. We’re your friends, and we care about you. Just let me pay the rent.”\n\nI felt stiff and wrong. It was a mistake, I thought dizzily, the words suffocating my mouth as his eyes followed me, warm coffee grounds I felt like I was drowning in every time I caught his gaze. \n\n*Kissing you was a mistake.* \n\n*Kissing the heir of a psychopath was a mistake*. \n\n*Kissing the man I wanted more than anything was a fucking mistake*. \n\nI swallowed it down, but it just came back up in a sour, watery paste.\n\n“Mika.” His voice softened. I shivered when his hand found my wrist, creeping down my arm, settling at my waist. His smile was warm. He didn’t need to say it. \n\nWe both knew what he was thinking, and I was terrified of it. Still, I let him kiss me, softly and tenderly, gently pressing me against the refrigerator. The kiss was warm. It felt right, his fingers cupping my cheek, turning me toward him. \n\nI waited for it. Jasper Le Croix was already set to marry a socialite whose name I didn’t even know. \n\nThe wedding was arranged for the summer, just after his twenty-second birthday, when he was expected to take over his father’s company. I found out through a brief phone call with his father. \n\nHis son was taken, he said, and whatever “thing” I had with Jasper was to cease immediately.\n\nJasper knew this. But instead of telling me the truth, his lips curved into a smirk. \n\nHis breath found my ear, warm and heavy, and then exploded into a childish giggle. \n\n“Can I tell you a secret?” he murmured, pressing his face into my shoulder. He was leaning on me, the weight of his body nearly sending me off balance. “Dad doesn’t *want* a fucking heir,” Jasper whispered. A shiver crept down my spine. \n\nHis voice twisted, effortlessly bleeding into an eerie imitation of his father. \n\n“It’s all for show. Dad wants to stay top dog.”\n\n“So.” I whispered. He wasn't the only one keeping secrets. I had my own bombshell. \n\nBut it could wait. \n\n“So,” He murmured into my shoulder. “You've got nothing to worry about. I'll cut all ties with my family, and we move into a new place far away from them.” He  paused. “It'll be a new start. For all of us.”\n\nI pulled away, my stomach lurching. “I said I don't want to move.”\n\nJasper pursed his lips and folded his arms. “Annie was right.” He grabbed a beer and headed for the door. \n\n“You are being stubborn.” He rolled his eyes, lingering in the doorway. “You're moving, Mika. I already paid your deposit. If we have to drag you to our new home, we will.” \n\nHis voice turned sing-song, as he danced back down the hallway. “You *know* we will!”\n\nPinpricks.\n\nHis words jabbed into my spine like tiny needles.\n\n“What?” I said, my voice catching before it rose into a yell.\n\nMy cheeks flushed hot. Tears stung my eyes.\n\n“You already paid for me?” I trailed after him through the kitchen and up the stairs. “When I told you not to?”\n\nBANG. \n\nA sudden deafening THUD splintered my thoughts. I froze, mouth open, breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t scream. Could only watch my roommate's body fall back, plunging down the stairs. \n\nHis head hit each step with a sickening thud, once, twice, three times, four times, with the fifth sending him catapulting backward, his arms flailing, until he crumpled at the bottom. \n\nFor a heartbeat, maybe more, I couldn’t move. Then reality struck. \n\nI blinked, my mouth full of cotton. “Jasper?”\n\nI dropped to my knees, rolling him onto his back. My hands came away wet, warm, slick with blood. His eyes were still open, unfocused. Blood trickled down his temple. He was still warm. \n\n“Jasper.” I said his name like he was still breathing, like he wasn't limp and wrong, tangled in my arms. I didn’t realize I was sobbing until the silence crashed over me like a wave.\n\n“Annie?” I shrieked, her name ripping from my mouth in an animalistic cry. \n\n“Wait here, okay?” I whispered, cupping Jasper’s face in my hands. He didn't move, his head lolling. “Wait here.” \n\nMy breath caught when more blood came away, soaking my fingers and palms. “Wait. Please just don't move, all right?”\n\nI stood, and my legs buckled. I hit the floor hard. Couldn’t move. Tried to crawl toward the lounge, but my limbs were heavy and wrong, and useless. My eyes fluttered. \n\nSomething was… wrong.\n\nI coughed, choked, rolled onto my side. Slammed my sleeve over my mouth. There was something in the air. I forced myself to my knees. Grabbed Jasper’s ankles and began dragging him toward the front door. There was no air, no oxygen, nothing for me to breathe. \n\nI opened the door, sucked in gasps of air, and pulled him outside. Then turned back for Annie and Harry. Harry was curled on the floor, surrounded by shards of broken glass. Annie lay crumpled in the hallway.\n\nI screamed for help. Dropped beside them, shaking them. “Wake up.”\n\nI shook them violently, screaming, until Mrs Wayley gently pulled me back.\n\nBut they didn’t move. They were so still. So cold.\n\nThey were all dead on arrival. I was sitting next to Jasper, my hands squeezed in his, when they called it. \n\nHis lips were blue under a plastic mask, eyes half-open. “Time of death: 8:53pm. Cause: blunt force trauma to the head. Twenty-one-year-old male—” \n\nTheir voices mangled together in my head. They didn’t make sense. I still held his hand, even when it fell limp. \n\nI still wrapped my arms around him, like he’d sit up and pull me closer. Investigators said it was due to the damper on the fireplace. It broke, and all the oxygen had been sucked from the air. \n\nSomething like that. I wasn't really listening. The therapist prescribed me pills so I'd stop feeling sad. But I didn't want to take them. I wanted to stay with them. \n\n“It's not your fault, you know,” Jasper’s voice pulled me back to the present, the two of us sitting on the top stair. Annie was gone from the bottom step. Harry’s yells had faded from the lounge. Jasper  stretched his legs, letting out a sigh. \n\n“I know you blame yourself. That's why you're not letting us go.” he rolled his eyes, shooting me a grin. “You're stubborn, Mika,” he nudged me. “Always have been.”\n\nBut I didn't want him to go. \n\nIf I stayed like this forever, sitting on the top stair of our home, I could hold onto them, just a little longer. \n\n“Okay, but that's not healthy,” Jasper murmured. \n\n“I know this sounds cliché or whatever, but you've got to move on, dude. Your mom is worried about you, and rightfully so. Why do you keep coming here?” \n\nWhen I didn’t respond, he sighed. \n\n“Take your pills.” Jasper stood up. He didn’t face me. I could see he was already crying, or trying not to cry, and ultimately failing. “You're going to close your eyes, and I'm going to go, all right?” His voice was steady. “No tearful goodbye. No regrets. Because it wasn’t your fault.”\n\nIt wasn't my fault. \n\nSomething in the air shifted, almost like the temperature was rising. My phone buzzed again, and I looked down at it. I glanced up, and Jasper was gone. \n\n“Mom?” my voice broke when I finally answered. \n\n“Mika.” Mom’s voice was a sob. “Oh, god, where are you? Sweetie, it was a beautiful service. I wish you could have seen it.”\n\nI slowly got to my feet, making my way downstairs. “Yeah, Mom.” I said. “I wish I could have seen it too.”\n\nThe words caught on my tongue when I noticed it. So subtle, faded, and yet there in plain sight. I crouched on the bottom step, peering at the smear of red on the wall. The world jerked suddenly, and I was standing on the top of the stairs. \n\nJasper was standing in front of me, his eyes wide. “Just let me pay for you,” he said. “I promise you won't have to pay it back.”\n\n“I'm not accepting 50K.” I whispered. \n\nHe tilted his head, lips curving. “Why?” Jasper rolled his eyes. “It's pocket change,” he sighed. “I already paid the deposit for you. Annie finalized the lease.”\n\nShame slammed into me, ice cold waves threatening to send me to my knees. “You already paid for me?” I managed to choke out. “When I told you not to?”\n\nJasper shrugged. “Well, yeah. Like I said, it's nothing. Pocket change.” \n\nHe grinned, and it was that smile that set something off inside me. \n\nI shoved him, not hard enough to throw him down the stairs. Just a push, sending him slightly off balance. \n\n“You're an asshole,” I spat. \n\nHis lip curled. He was a Le Croix, after all. “Relax. Jeez, Milka, it's like you *want* to be a victim. We’re your friends. We just want to help you, you know? This house is going to kill us.” \n\nHis eyes widened, frantic, suddenly, when he realized what he'd said. “Fuck.” He ran both hands through his hair. “I didn’t mean it like that!”\n\nI saw myself lash out. Arms flying. But more than that. I saw red. Bright, scalding red that blurred the edges of my vision. He dodged, eyes wide, mouth open in a silent cry. “Mika, what are you doing?!”\n\nI grabbed him. My hands clamped around his wrists, and I saw his eyes. Wide and brown, and terrified. And I shoved… hard. He didn't get a chance to cry out, his expression crumpling, eyes flying open. \n\nI watched his body tumble down the stairs, limbs flailing, catapulting down each step, before landing with a sickening BANG. I stood frozen, chest heaving, heart pounding against my ribs. Annie appeared at the bottom, a frenzy of tangled gold. \n\nShe was carrying a box for her shoes. It slipped out of her hands. \n\n“Jasper?” Annie shrieked, falling to her knees. Her hands fumbled across his neck, his chest, then flew to her mouth. \n\nHer eyes met mine. \n\n“It’s… it's okay,” she whispered, when I didn’t move. “Harry! Harry, call an ambulance!”\n\nAnnie scrambled up the stairs, her arms reaching for me. They were warm. Comforting. She held me close, tears soaking into my shoulder. \n\n“Mika, it’s okay,” she said, her voice splintering. “Jasper’s going to be okay. It was an accident.” Her lips pressed to my ear, breath shuddering. \n\n“You’re okay.”\n\nI nodded, slowly, dizzily. I was okay, I thought. I was okay. \n\nMy head was spinning. But I saw Jasper’s blood pooling on the floor. I saw his body twisted in tangled knots. \n\nNo. \n\nI shoved Annie back. \n\nShe didn’t resist, like she already knew. Instead, she clung onto me. \n\nAnd then I grabbed her, all of her, wrapping my arms around my best friend, and hurled her tiny body down the stairs. That’s when I saw Harry in the doorway. His eyes wild. His mouth open in a silent cry.\n\n“Harry.”\n\nI stumbled toward him, but my apologies tasted sour. \n\n“I'm sorry,” I said. \n\nBut was I? \n\nHe didn’t scream, striding into the lounge and grabbing his phone.\n\n“I’m calling an ambulance,” Harry whispered, voice breaking, tears sliding down his cheeks. \n\nHe dialed with shaking fingers. “I need an ambulance for my friends.” he broke down. But the phone screen was black. \n\nI saw red again. Bright red. Invasive red. Painful red. In two steps, I took the empty glass from the table and smashed it over his head. \n\nHarry hit the floor without a sound. \n\n“I’m sorry,” I choked out. \n\nI dragged his body into the hallway, then lit the fireplace, and shut the flue. \n\nI waited. Waited for the air to thin, for my breaths to become labored. When my vision started to blur, I pulled them. \n\nJasper, Annie, Harry, outside, one by one, laying them out on the patio. \n\nJasper was still breathing. His gaze trailed after me, lazy, eyes flickering, as I collapsed beside him on the lawn. I was choking. And then his eyes finally fluttered. \n\nOnce I knew he was dead, I fumbled for my phone with shaking hands. I dialed and held it to my ear. “Mr. Le Croix?” I whispered, choking on thin, poisoned air. \n\n“I’ve done a bad thing,” I whispered, crawling over to Jasper’s body. “Please help me.”\n\n*“Mika?”*\n\nMom’s voice brought me back to the present once more. “Sweetie, are you at the house? I'll come and get you, baby.”\n\n“No.”\n\nMy voice was choked and wrong. I scrolled through the notifications lighting up my screen. All of them were from PayPal. \n\nYou have received $500.000 from Simon Le Croix. \n\nYou have received $100.000 from Simon Le Croix. \n\nYou have received $700.000 from Simon Le Croix. \n\n“You *bitch*.”\n\nI glanced up, and there he was, sitting with his knees to his chest, dried blood on his temple and under his nose. \n\nHis head was cocked, eyes narrowed, lips curled in a smile that wasn’t quite a smile, more of an ironic snarl. His gaze followed my finger through every payment his father had sent.\n\nJasper Le Croix wasn’t a hallucination this time. He wasn’t the man who told me it wasn’t my fault. The ghost I imagined.\n\nThe pathetic apparition who held me, told me everything was okay. He snorted, eyes dark, and turned away from my phone. \n\nBut I could feel his anger, like a wave crashing over me. \n\nNot a hallucination. \n\nBecause Jasper Le Croix would never fucking tell me that. He would never tell me it wasn’t my fault… if it was. \n\nAnnie was back, sitting on the bottom step, blonde curls nestled in her arms. Harry was perched on the middle step, legs stretched out, arms folded, head tipped back like he owned the silence.\n\nThe lights flickered and then went out, leaving three figures carved into the darkness. I wasn’t hallucinating my friends anymore. I was seeing them for who they really were, the reality of them bleeding through the gaps. Who I had tried to suppress. Tried to run away from.\n\nAnd they were *pissed*.",

However, long time fans may chaff at the adjustments.\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[Andrenoob](https://opencritic.com/outlet/911/andrenoob)** - [Relict King ](https://opencritic.com/critic/11181/relict-king-) - *Spanish* - [9 / 10](https://andrenoob.com/2025/09/22/review-silent-hill-f-analisis-opinion/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill F is the triumphant return of the series, a masterpiece of psychological horror that fuses a Japanese setting with visceral storytelling, brilliant puzzles, and demanding combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Arabhardware ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/865/arabhardware-)** - [Moustafa Argoun](https://opencritic.com/critic/11447/moustafa-argoun) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://arabhardware.net/reviews/silent-hill-f-review)\n\n&gt;Although Silent Hill F is not without its flaws, its strengths far outweigh them. As a revival of a series that until recently lay dormant in Konami’s vaults, it has done a commendable job of recapturing the franchise’s roots while introducing entirely new elements. And if you’re a fan of horror games, this enchanting and atmospheric experience is one you shouldn’t miss.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Furkan Oğur](https://opencritic.com/critic/11440/furkan-o-ur) - *Turkish* - [75 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/silent-hill-f-inceleme/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill F is the first new entry in the series in a long time. While it gets some things right, it falls short in others. Even though it doesn’t fully capture the classic Silent Hill feel, it’s still a good game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[BaziCenter](https://opencritic.com/outlet/482/bazicenter)** - محسن رحیمی - *Persian* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.bazicenter.com/review/game/silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;The developers of the game paint on their canvas terrifying and shocking moments that will remain in our memories for a long time. With all its positive points, this work becomes one of the best horror works released in 2025.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Brendan Frye](https://opencritic.com/critic/400/brendan-frye) - [9 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/silent-hill-f-ps5/)\n\n&gt;NeoBards Entertainment has taken bold risks with Silent Hill f, and the result is one of the most unsettling, personal and rewarding horror games in years.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/news/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;To say I'm disappointed with Silent Hill f is an understatement, but I'm also not surprised. You could give this game a totally different name, and it would be just a passable survival horror game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Jaz Sagoo](https://opencritic.com/critic/6460/jaz-sagoo) - [90 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is the entry fans have been waiting for since 2004’s The Room. The shift from small-town America to rural Japan gives the game a distinct identity, allowing the developers to craft a unique experience that still captures the spirit of the series. Ryukishi07’s storytelling shines, with your journal steadily filling with information and mature themes explored in subtle yet impactful ways. While combat has seen improvements over its predecessors, it still pales in comparison to the game’s atmosphere and puzzle design. After two long decades, and a remake of a genre classic, Silent Hill is finally back.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cloud Dosage](https://opencritic.com/outlet/951/cloud-dosage)** - [Jon Scarr](https://opencritic.com/critic/11148/jon-scarr) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://clouddosage.com/silent-hill-f-game-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f pulls the series into 1960s Japan with a story that feels personal and unsettling. Combat has weight, puzzles hit hard, and exploration keeps you on edge, even if the sanity system doesn’t fully deliver. The atmosphere is the real star, with grotesque enemies, creeping flora, and a soundtrack that sticks. Silent Hill f isn’t perfect, but it reminded me why this series still matters.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/2030282-silent-hill-f-review-haunting-return-to-form)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is the first original and truly great Silent Hill game in over 15 years.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Simone Cantini](https://opencritic.com/critic/10829/simone-cantini) - *Italian* - [80 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/silent-hill-f-321838/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a bold experiment, breaking from the past while keeping the series’ soul. The new setting and tone work surprisingly well, delivering emotional impact and a fresh, unconventional protagonist. Stunning art direction and sound design capture both unease and beauty. Unfortunately, the clunky, frustrating combat system drags the experience down. Neobards took a brave risk and partly succeeded, but the game could have been so much more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [James Busby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9858/james-busby) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-review-terrifying-horror-that-rivals-silent-hill-2-3253320/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a bold new direction for Konami’s iconic survival horror series. While it may put a heavier emphasis on combat, NeoBards has expertly concocted a nightmarish cocktail oozing with enough stomach-churning monsters, disgustingly beautiful environments, and psychological dread to be just as good, if not better than, Silent Hill 2. \n&gt;\n&gt;Hinako’s world is suffocating and compelling, and I can’t wait to delve even further into the dark, damp town of Ebisugaoka to uncover more endings. If this is the quality we can expect from Silent Hill going forward, then I have never been more excited to step into its fog-filled future.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Cassie Mammone](https://opencritic.com/critic/10425/cassie-mammone) - *German* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/39682)\n\n&gt;After playing through Silent Hill f, I can confidently say that the new main installment in the series is finally a major success again. The new Japanese setting, with schoolgirl Hinako as the protagonist, is perfect for a symbolically charged story full of psychological horror. Unfortunately, even on the lowest difficulty setting, the combat system takes up too much space in the gameplay mix.\n\n-------------\n\n**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - [Elena Chapella](https://opencritic.com/critic/10863/elena-chapella) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is completely distinct from any other entry in the franchise, but also firmly committed to being faithful to Team Silent's visions, and it carried out those visions wonderfully. Not only is the game a horror masterpiece, it's a Silent Hill masterpiece, finally giving veteran fans the long-awaited relief we've been craving. While being a commentary on feminine fears and oppressive societies, Silent Hill f gives much for players to chew on, and even more to swallow, in the most visually striking and grotesque entry the series has seen yet. The first new Silent Hill entry in over a decade is everything fans could ever hope it to be and then some, cementing itself as an instant classic not just for the franchise, but for survival horror overall.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Endless Mode](https://opencritic.com/outlet/972/endless-mode)** - [Elijah Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/6743/elijah-gonzalez) - [90 / 100](https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/silent-hill-f/silent-hill-f-review)\n\n&gt;It’s a sequel that understands what makes these games tick, both in the moment-to-moment particulars of being trapped in a fog bank where you can’t see five feet in front of you, and in the deeper specifics of using scares to navigate the fraying psyche of its protagonist.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Enternity.gr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr)** - [Konstantinos Kalkanis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7432/konstantinos-kalkanis) - *Greek* - [7 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/silent-hill-f-review/97399.html)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f, although flawed, shows great promise for Konami's future plans for Silent Hill.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-silent-hill-f-horror-vero-pezzi-66163.html)\n\n&gt;The only shame is that the gameplay suffers from some notable shortcomings and fails to keep up with the excellence of the writing and the technical and artistic component.

Moving away from the American town has brought a freshness and depth to the story that I haven't seen in the series since SH2, and changes to the combat system are working well. Silent Hill has finally found its way and emerged from the fog reborn. Disgusting, poignant, digging deep into the psyche.

We are faced with a game that innovatively utilizes the principles, rules and identity dimensions of its series and portrays some of them more broadly than before. The game's narrative is engaging, deep and complex, its meaningful symbolism and integrity appear in the dimensions of design and narrative returned, breathtaking atmosphere and wonderful music. Silent Hill f is a bold, intelligent and deep game that tries to try new approaches and move the franchise forward in a meaningful way.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Patrick Meurs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10557/patrick-meurs) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-nieuw-dorp-dezelfde-rusteloze-droom/6152-1-1-18)\n\n&gt;Though set in Japan, Silent Hill f more than earns the name: over about twelve hours it delivers the franchise’s hallmark mix of metaphor-rich storytelling, sometimes opaque puzzles, and brutally unsettling scenarios that invite reflection—so while purists may balk at the setting change, open-minded players will likely find their doubts quickly fade.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Sebastian Kasparek](https://opencritic.com/critic/3746/sebastian-kasparek) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-a-horrifying-masterpiece-that-got-into-my-he/z279b)\n\n&gt;After many long years, Silent Hill has received its most exceptional installment, reintroducing the series to the Premier League of horror and regaining its reputation as the pinnacle of virtual terror.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Ben Chard](https://opencritic.com/critic/5325/ben-chard) - [92 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/silent-hill-f/review)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f lives up to the series’ legacy of offering a fantastic story that gets you thinking about more than what you see.

Even its combat system, rough at first glance, proves surprisingly engaging in practice.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Oscar Taylor-Kent](https://opencritic.com/critic/3963/oscar-taylor-kent) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is fantastic at evolving that sense of unease and vagueness that's so defined the series in the past.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Generación Xbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox)** - *Spanish* - [100 / 100](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-silent-hill-f-sobresaliente-y-el-juego-mas-perturbador-de-la-saga/)\n\n&gt;For me, it's a 10/10 game. I could probably be more meticulous and find some snags in the combat system and some mechanics, but they're minor things, and I can say, without fear, that Konami is coming back in a big way with this new Silent Hill.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Hobby Consolas](https://opencritic.com/outlet/499/hobby-consolas)** - *Spanish* - [90 / 100](https://www.hobbyconsolas.com/reviews/analisis-silent-hill-f-nueva-estupenda-forma-perderse-niebla-1484317)\n\n&gt;Konami has been brave in rethinking the series' setting and certain gameplay schemes, and for us, the move has paid off. Silent Hill F is a game that draws you in irresistibly and even compels you to replay it. Based on its atmosphere, gameplay, and plot, it's a true horror hit in 2025.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Tristan Ogilvie](https://opencritic.com/critic/236/tristan-ogilvie) - [7 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f presents a fresh new setting to explore and a fascinatingly dark story to unravel, but its melee-focussed combat takes a big swing that doesn’t quite land.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN India](https://opencritic.com/outlet/898/ign-india)** - [Rayan Sayyed  ](https://opencritic.com/critic/9467/rayan-sayyed-) - [9 / 10](https://in.ign.com/silent-hill-f-2025/242117/review/silent-hill-f-review-franchise-finds-new-life-in-japanese-small-town-horror)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f pushes the series in a bold new direction without losing its soul. The Japanese setting gives the game a fresh identity while still feeling unmistakably like Silent Hill. With a story rich in character and classic gameplay that feels familiar yet refreshed, this is the revival the series has been waiting for, and it sets the stage for Silent Hill to grow in a distinct direction.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Alessandro Digioia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8524/alessandro-digioia) - *Italian* - [7.5 / 10](https://it.ign.com/silent-hill-f/220914/review/silent-hill-f-la-recensione)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a compelling yet flawed return for Konami's iconic horror series: narratively strong and visually striking, it immerses players in a haunting psychological nightmare set in the eerie Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. Hinako's touching and unsettling story is the highlight, but the experience is held back by basic combat, limited enemy types, and a design that requires multiple playthroughs to fully understand the plot without enough gameplay variety. Despite interesting ideas and solid presentation, the game loses momentum over time, feeling repetitive and lessening its emotional impact.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - Mario Sánchez - *Spanish* - [10 / 10](https://es.ign.com/silent-hill-f/221366/review/analisis-de-silent-hill-f-una-experiencia-oscura-y-psicologicamente-profunda-que-revitalizara-la-sag)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan with a dark, symbolic, and psychologically deep story. It combines exploration, clever puzzles, and more complex combat than previous entries, while still retaining the essence of the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=309727)\n\n&gt;Though its heavier focus on action initially raised concerns among longtime fans, the series’ trademark psychological horror and mystery remain intact in its new 1960s Japan setting. With Ryukishi07’s solid storytelling and layered replay value, it firmly retains the essence of Silent Hill.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [9.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;If you’re looking for a complete psychological horror experience, with excellent technical performance, high-quality sound design, an artistic direction that enhances the overall atmosphere, smooth gameplay featuring challenging puzzles, and a powerful story rich in symbolism that will stay with you for a long time, then Silent Hill f should be your next choice.\n\n-------------\n\n**[LevelUp](https://opencritic.com/outlet/454/levelup)** - *Spanish* - [8.8 / 10](https://www.levelup.com/reviews/silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Chris White](https://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is genuinely unnerving, with a strong story and intense combat that earns its place as a worthy entry in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Valerio Tosetti](https://opencritic.com/critic/8787/valerio-tosetti) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3809/silent-hill-f.html)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a beautiful game, with deep lore and a compelling story that makes it shine. However, its qualities are held back by dated gameplay mechanics and a poor and misleading puzzle text translation (reviewed in Italian). Yet it's an experience worth living, especially for its impressive narrative strength and world-building.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [James Carr](https://opencritic.com/critic/8640/james-carr) - [3.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/09/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f delivers a compelling and creepy horror experience, with unique enemies and environments that feel smartly focused on telling Hinako's story. The focus on societal expectations of women and the competition forced upon them, even between friends and sisters, gives the horror elements a more pointed focus. It delivers on themes throughout, and while the combat is only just fine, some of the more compelling ideas, like the economy of Silent Hill f create a compelling and spooky experience. Obtuse puzzles and a lack of variety in combat hold Silent Hill f back from reaching the peak of the survival horror genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Niche Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/298/niche-gamer)** - Fingal Belmont - [10 / 10](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-frighteningly-fresh/)\n\n&gt;This is the true fifth Silent Hill that fans deserve after The Room. It’s a fascinating and haunting exploration into new territory; a dark take on the “coming of age” drama that’s distinctly Silent Hill, with visceral and challenging combat and diabolical puzzles. Silent Hill is back… we just had to go to Japan to get there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8.5 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/09/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Despite its departure from the familiar urban landscapes of previous entries, Silent Hill f stands as a compelling and worthy addition to the franchise’s storied legacy. From its hauntingly atmospheric opening to its emotionally charged and unsettling finale, Hinako’s journey offers a memorable experience that will spark discussion long after the credits roll.\n&gt;\n&gt;The game is remarkably accessible, catering to both narrative-driven players and those seeking a deeper challenge. Whether you’re here for the story or eager to test your skills with elevated puzzle and combat difficulty, Silent Hill f delivers a layered horror experience that adapts to your playstyle. While some minor issues may arise depending on personal preferences, the overall package offers something for every fan of psychological horror.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Oyungezer Online](https://opencritic.com/outlet/487/oyungezer-online)** - Beril Sergün - *Turkish* - [8.5 / 10](https://oyungezer.com.tr/inceleme/silent-hill-f-inceleme)\n\n&gt;SILENT HILL f blends the foggy, oppressive atmosphere of classic Silent Hill with the hallmarks of Japanese horror, delivering an experience that is both aesthetically rich and deeply unsettling. The narrative depth brought by Ryukishi07’s writing, combined with the intricate design of Ebisugaoka town, its overarching symbolism, and Hinako’s diaries, elevates the game far beyond a mere spin-off. That said, the question of whether it really needed to carry the Silent Hill name remains open for debate; it could just as easily have stood on its own as a Japanese horror title in the vein of Fatal Frame.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer)** - [Elie Gould](https://opencritic.com/critic/10501/elie-gould) - [90 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is an excellent next step for this accomplished horror series.

The chaos and fear takes over you at every turn, and while it has some performance issues on the PS5 Pro, it doesn't diminish how artistically beautiful, fun, and horrifying this game is. Without a doubt, a title that should be in the collection of any gamer and fan of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Ben Fellows](https://opencritic.com/critic/10613/ben-fellows) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-ps5/)\n\n&gt;From its nerve-wracking combat to its dense puzzles, from grotesque enemy designs to quiet moments of reflection, it's a consistently engaging experience. Silent Hill f proves the franchise still has the power to unsettle and surprise. It's a brilliant return that respects its roots while boldly moving forward.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [James Berich](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-berich) - [9 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/ps5-reviews/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review-old-fog-new-tricks/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f resoundingly demonstrates a clear grasp of what makes Silent Hill work. Its storytelling is equal parts sinister and restrained, bolstered by a combat system that’s simple but satisfying. Throw in some challenging boss battles, and you’ve got a Silent Hill experience that meaningfully expands on the original games. It’s a subtly scary adventure that dares to be different, while at the same time retaining the core that makes Silent Hill so special. While some elements and the difficulty might be grating for people and the skill system is bizarrely undercooked, Silent Hill f is an enjoyable and chilling experience from beginning to end, and unlike anything you've ever played.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Liam Croft](https://opencritic.com/critic/1009/liam-croft) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/silent-hill-f)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill F takes the survival horror series in a new direction, which pays off for the most part. It's quite different, and hardcore fans will have to accept that. Combat is a heavy focus, and the move to Japan means there's a different kind of tone and atmosphere in the air. Technical problems aside, it marks a bold new chapter in the Silent Hill saga. Accept it for what it is, and you'll find one of PS5's most intense experiences.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Restart.run](https://opencritic.com/outlet/940/restart-run)** - [Len Hafer](https://opencritic.com/critic/10339/len-hafer) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.restart.run/articles/silent-hill-f-review?utm_source=OpenCritic&amp;utm_medium=backlink&amp;utm_campaign=Aggregators)\n\n&gt;While it may not satisfy those looking for more of a classic survival horror experience, I absolutely loved the heart-wrenching and vibrantly inventive journey that was Silent Hill f. Each finished playthrough beckoned me back into the gloom to start another, even though the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. Because I still had more questions, and Silent Hill f still had more answers. I'll be thinking about this one for a long time, and it may just become an instant horror classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://www.saudigamer.com/review/silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;A haunting and harrowing journey into a seemingly quiet Japanese town that despite its unfamiliarity manages to captivate its audience to elicit both empathy and horror.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Donovan Erskine](https://opencritic.com/critic/4485/donovan-erskine) - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/146036/silent-hill-f-review-score)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f enjoys getting under your skin. It’s a game that gives you objectives like “go on ahead” and “escape.” Every jump that the game elicited from me was usually followed by a wide grin. I loved the unique challenges that combat posed as I made my way from puzzle to puzzle, and the story’s overarching mystery is one worthy of the Silent Hill name.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/silent-hill-f-recensione)\n\n&gt;Even though some gameplay mechanics are questionable and certain sections seem out of step with the original spirit of the series, Silent Hill f still manages to leave a profound impression. It's not a perfect experience, but it's a work that must be approached with a clear, informed eye, capable of grasping the complexity of the emotions that permeate the story. The game speaks directly to those who know the weight of their own fragility, to those who have learned that the mind can be a place as disturbing as any nightmare. In Silent Hill f, the horror isn't just external, but slowly creeps into the interior, into the unsaid, into distorted memories. It's a journey that, despite some notable lows, lays bare the most vulnerable part of humanity—the part that often hides behind silence.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SteamDeckHQ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/920/steamdeckhq)** - [Noah Kupetsky](https://opencritic.com/critic/10844/noah-kupetsky) - [4 / 5 ](https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f does have flaws, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons. The story sucked me in and combat was more fun than I expected. I am being more nit-picky with the issues I’m bringing up, but they ultimately never affected my enjoyment of the game, nor made me think twice about getting back into it for round 2. And a lot of the issues I had were erased as soon as New Game+ started, which was like a weight lifted off my shoulders.\n&gt;\n&gt;On top of that, it actually runs quite well on the Steam Deck. It’s definitely not perfect and needs compromises to run effectively, but the game is playable on the Deck and can look gorgeous. It may cost a little extra performance in 3-4 scenes, but they include graphical improvements I’d consider necessary to enjoy.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the end, Silent Hill f is a thrilling game, and if this keeps up, the future of AAA releases from Konami is going to look very bright.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [9.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-fear-and-fog-in-the-mountains/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f balances threat and reality in a way that kept me playing longer and longer per session.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Daniele Cucchiarelli](https://opencritic.com/critic/5494/daniele-cucchiarelli) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/silent-hill-f/silent-hill-f-recensione/)\n\n&gt;We had high expectations for this new instalment in the Konami series, and for once we can say that they were not disappointed. Silent Hill f is one of the best \"classic\" horror titles ever made. It manages to revamp the original formula by enriching gameplay that has very few flaws and delivering a deep, multifaceted, painful, unfiltered story that is worth experiencing more than once.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Karl Smart](https://opencritic.com/critic/2157/karl-smart) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/silent-hill-f-review-pc/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f does what the developers intended to do: Capture the soul and spirit of the first three Silent Hill games and put it into an unapologetically Japanese package. However, after playing the game, I walked away feeling like this was more like Forbidden Siren or Fatal Frame than a Silent Hill. The removal of the town itself is a big loss, but this game is one hell of a horror game that would have done really well even if it didn't have the Silent Hill brand attached to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Jade King](https://opencritic.com/critic/5922/jade-king) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;While Bloober Team’s remake of the legendary second entry was a positive step in the right direction, Silent Hill f feels like Konami finally cementing the survival horror icon’s return. It is an emotional, unpredictable, and unsettlingly beautiful glimpse into the worst parts of human nature. Hinako Shimizu’s journey is one designed to make the player ask uncomfortable yet necessary questions with no guarantees that you’ll enjoy the answers. But it’s through that bravery that Silent Hill f is able to achieve greatness.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Nick Petrasiti](https://opencritic.com/critic/5526/nick-petrasiti) - [10 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f isn't just a return to form, it's a landmark entry in the series.

For me, this isn't just Game of the Year material, it's an integral piece of Silent Hill history.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Tom's Guide](https://opencritic.com/outlet/851/toms-guide)** - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/silent-hill-f-review)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a true-to-form return for the franchise. It features a tantalizing story and world that offers a frightening introspection on the nature of sanity. The series' inherent psychological nature is ever-present, and it's made more impactful with refinements to stamina and health. Unfortunately, combat can still feel slightly janky. Despite its flaws, this is exactly what Silent Hill is all about.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TrueGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/449/truegaming)** - *Arabic* - [8 / 10](https://www.true-gaming.net/home/616011/silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f brings back the classic Silent Hill in a unique setting in 1960s Japan. The game looks both beautiful and unsettling at the same time, and the story is full of mysteries that are neatly uncovered over time and playthroughs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Wccftech](https://opencritic.com/outlet/304/wccftech)** - [Francesco De Meo](https://opencritic.com/critic/1717/francesco-de-meo) - [9 / 10](https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/)\n\n&gt;With a gripping and often disturbing story, a setting unlike anything seen before in the franchise, and gameplay that blends new ideas with a familiar framework, Silent Hill f shows that the series is not only back, but stronger than ever. While performance issues and a short runtime do impact the experience, they in no way diminish what is a triumphant return for one of the most important survival horror series ever.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8.5 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/9/22/reviews/147656-ps5-review-silent-hill-f/)\n\n&gt;Silent Hill f is a slow-burn horror game that doesn't put its best foot forward, but once it has its hooks in you, they're not coming out. The compelling and well-crafted story does a fantastic job of drawing you in and keeping you invested, even potentially through multiple playthroughs. The combat mechanics can feel a tad overdone. I think Silent Hill f is the best entirely new entry in the franchise in ages, and while it has its flaws, it shows that there's still plenty of life in Konami's franchise.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Josh Wise](https://opencritic.com/critic/7768/josh-wise) - [70%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/silent-hill-f/review/)\n\n&gt;Hinako, a girl in her early teens, leaves home in the midst of an argument with her father.

I was nervous at first because their website doesn’t allow reviews and I only saw 1 TikTok review but the videos from their page convinced me to get it. \n\nNeedless to say, I’m in LOVE with it. This is the MOST I’ve ever spent on any piece of clothing. I’m lower class so maybe my standards are low but this is by far the highest quality dress I’ve ever worn. It fits so well, it’s soft, it’s comfortable, the zipper, the stitching, the lacing, the pockets??? all of it is just so nice. I will be wearing this for our elopement and basically any chance I can. I think it’ll work great as a Ren faire dress too! Eeeeeeeee! \n\n**side notes, it’s honestly so much thicker than I expected. Pictures don’t do it justice. The layering scrunches up so nice I feel like a fairy princess ahhhhh",

It’s an early attempt at benchmarking AI-driven visibility, but results vary depending on niche and geography.\n\n* **Tool:** Semrush AI Visibility Index\n* **Release:** August 2025 (public beta)\n* **Scope:** AI search platforms (Google SGE, Perplexity, ChatGPT Browse)\n* **Regions:** currently US, UK, DE only\n* **Limitation:** Data updates weekly, not real-time\n\n# Step-by-step (How to test it yourself)\n\n1. Log in to Semrush → **SEO Dashboard**.\n2. Go to **“AI Visibility Index”** under Competitive Research.\n3. Enter your **domain** or a competitor’s domain.\n4. Select **region** (US, UK, DE).\n5. Review the breakdown by **queries, competitors, AI answers**.\n6. Export results → compare with **traditional visibility index**.\n\n\n\n**Q: Is this different from normal keyword visibility?**  \nYes, instead of SERP rankings, it tracks mentions and links in AI-generated answers.\n\n**Q: Which platforms are covered?**  \nGoogle’s SGE, Perplexity, ChatGPT Browse (beta), more planned.\n\n**Q: How reliable is it?**  \nStill beta. Great for directional insight, not perfect for ROI reporting yet.\n\n**Q: Can small businesses use it effectively?**  \nYes, but data density is lower in local/regional niches. Works best for broad topics.\n\n**Q: Cost?**  \nIncluded in Semrush Guru + Business plans, as of September 2025.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Semrush AI Visibility Index overview](https://www.semrush.com/news/ai-visibility-index/)\n* [Google SGE documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/ai-overview)\n* [Perplexity AI search benchmarks](https://www.perplexity.ai/)\n* [Initial industry reactions (Search Engine Roundtable)](https://www.seroundtable.com/)\n\nThe Semrush AI Visibility Index is an early but useful way to measure how often your site shows up in AI-generated search answers, worth testing if you’re monitoring future-proof SEO.\n\nHas anyone here compared their traditional visibility vs. AI visibility in the same niche?

    "text": "So I went to Sikkim.\nAn off-season trip to Sikkim came with its pros and cons. I really wanted to visit more off-beat places like Yuksom or Okhrey, but the travel time didn't make it an appealing idea. So here's what I did instead:\n\nDay 1: Long journey from Bagdogra Airport to Gangtok. Had dinner at M.G Road and crashed.\n\nDay 2: Visited Enchey Monastery - sat through a puja ritual. It was a profound, yet calming experience. From there, I hiked to Ganesh Tok (quite a hike). The view was obscured by the mist, but it was a lovely vibe. Met a fellow traveler there and spent the evening eating and shopping with them.\n\nDay 3: A day trip to Nathula Pass, Baba Mandir (new) and Tsomgo Lake (aka Changu Lake). The weather was skittish, but supportive for the most part.\n\nDay 4: Left for Ravangla and reached around 3.30 pm. Visited the famous Buddha Park, where I was greeted with a massive downpour. Ravangla was (unexpectedly for me) really cold. Eventually, got a clear view of the Buddha statue and spent some time admiring the park. Walked back to the homestay, had great food, spent time with the sweet hosts, doggo and cats, and called it a night.\n\nDay 5: Left Ravangla for Pelling. It was a long and arduous journey having to change shared jeeps twice and enduring a pretty bad road for half of the journey. Reached Pelling around 4.30 - 5 pm. Rested, had dinner and crashed.\n\nDay 6: Hired a cabbie for a day trip to Khecheopalri Lake, Rimbi Waterfalls and 2 local spots on the way back (Rabdentse Ruins and Pemayangtse Monastery). This was clearly the highlight of my trip. The hike to the viewpoint atop the lake was worth it. I was blessed with clear weather (for the most part) on this day. Made friends with a little fellow on the top, shared cookies, chatted and enjoyed the serene embrace of the lake and the surrounding forest area. The visit to the ruins, after a hike through the forest, was lovely, too.\n\nDay 7: Left from Pelling for Darjeeling around 11.00 am. Again, a tedious journey with plenty of waiting time between shared jeep switches. Managed to reach Darjeeling around 5.30 pm. Lay on the bed, stretching my weary legs, and later headed towards M.G Road for food. Visited the famous Glenary's, had a snack, did some shopping and moved on to a different outlet for a burger. Returned to the room and crashed.\n\nDay 8: Left Darjeeling early in the morning for Bagdogra Airport. I found myself incredibly lucky to have caught the most beautiful view of the Kanchenjunga range right from my waiting spot. Glad the trip ended on a high note.\n\nSome observations and learnings:\n\nThere are practically no buses to commute from one town to another, so relying on shared jeeps (if you don't want to take a private cab) can be  both tedious and time-consuming. It's best to leave early in the morning for the best chance at reducing waiting time. They usually pack in 10 passengers per jeep and it can get quite cramped and uncomfortable.\n\nCommuting within Gangtok can also get expensive if you stay far from the main market (M.G Road). The cabbies are generally quite polite and well-behaved though. You can negotiate deals for local sightseeing with them.\n\nIf you like hiking, choose to stay at places like Pelling or smaller towns like Yuksom/Okhrey/Uttarey or even Khecheopalri or other villages for the best experience. Pelling was lush, quiet and inviting, but can get boring for those who like more lively places like Gangtok.\n\nOverall, it was an enriching experience visiting this beautiful state and meeting its friendly people. I'm now better informed for a future visit there.\n\nApproximate cost of the trip - 20k plus flights (9k). Most of the cost was attributed to travel and commute. I stayed in an AirBnB, a homestay, hotel, and a hostel.",

Companies with 0.6 stars, and thousands of easily searchable warnings and complaints. Customers always have problems getting a booking fulfilled, get a refund, or even get someone on the phone.  Why are they even listed?  Why does Google allow people to be tricked, stranded abroad, and then ignored by them?  People who don't travel much end up in nightmare scenarios when using these companies.",

Both can hit for similar damage ceilings, but they achieve it in very different ways.\n\n# Altaria (New Release)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* 10 more HP (120 vs 110)\n* No weakness\n* Can attack turn 2 going first (since paired with a baby mon for dual-type energy setup)\n* Doesn’t rely on Supporter cards to reach max damage\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Needs to be paired with a baby mon for dual-type energy to unlock full damage\n* Not searchable with Trainers the way Silvally is\n\n# Silvally (Established Meta)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Searchable by Trainers\n* Already has existing support and proven meta presence\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Slightly lower HP (110 vs 120)\n* Has Fighting weakness (+20), which can be relevant\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nAltaria feels like a stronger standalone card (better HP, no weakness, can swing turn 2 without Supporters), but Silvally is way more consistent thanks to its Trainer searchability and established support.\n\nWhat do you guys think, will the new Altaria actually better, or will Silvally still be the go-to because of consistency?",

They’re offering an upgrade to an evertune bridge for $300 instead of a hardtail. Making the overall cost about $1000. I know an aftermarket evertune install is roughly $600 so doing the upgrade would be cheaper. However, I’m wondering if it’s even necessary. I probably want to tune it a half/whole step down from standard VI. Never had a guitar with one so I don’t know the pros and cons or jf it’s worth it.",

What's your setup?\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm in the process of setting up my home media system (with an LG CX TV) and I've gone down the rabbit hole of how to best watch my movie and TV show collection. I've landed on the classic home theater dilemma and I'd love to get this community's opinion.\n\nIt seems to boil down to two main camps:\n\n**Camp A: The Home Media Server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, etc.)**\n* **Pros:** Unbeatable convenience with a beautiful \"Netflix-style\" interface for your own media. Your entire library is centralized, searchable, and instantly accessible. No need to store physical cases. You can stream to any device, anywhere.\n* **Cons:** The potential for quality loss. Even with direct 1:1 rips (remuxes), you're dependent on your home network. More importantly, most smart TV apps (like the one on my LG) can't handle lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD MA, forcing the server to transcode the audio to a compressed format.\n\n**Camp B: The Dedicated 4K Blu-ray Player &amp; Physical Discs**\n* **Pros:** The absolute, undisputed champion for quality. You get the highest possible video bitrate with zero compression artifacts. Crucially, you get lossless, uncompressed audio (Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD MA) sent directly to your sound system. It's the film exactly as the director intended.\n* **Cons:** Convenience takes a major hit. You have to store physical cases, manually swap discs, and sit through unskippable warnings and trailers. No slick, all-in-one library interface.\n\nI'm torn between the incredible convenience of a streaming server and the uncompromising quality of physical discs.\n\nSo, my questions to you all are:\n\n1.  Which camp are you in, and why?\n2.  Do you run a hybrid system? (e.g., Plex for TV shows and casual viewing, but physical discs for your absolute favorite, must-watch films?)\n3.  For those with high-end audio setups, is the audio quality difference between streamed media and a Blu-ray disc truly night and day?\n4.  What are some real-world pros and cons that a newcomer might not be considering?\n\nAppreciate any advice you can share!",

    "text": "Best Scrunch Socks 2025: Top Picks &amp; Reviews\n[[Check Latest Arrivals scrunch socks on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=scrunch socks)\n    \n# Best Scrunch Socks 2025: Top Picks &amp; Reviews\n\nScrunch socks are back in a big way. These comfortable and stylish socks are no longer relegated to the fashion faux pas list.In fact, they've become a must-have accessory for anyone looking to add a touch of vintage charm and modern comfort to their wardrobe. Finding the right pair, however, can be tricky. With so many options available, it's essential to consider factors like material, elasticity, and overall style. This review will break down some of the top scrunch socks expected to dominate in 2025, helping you find the perfect pair for any occasion.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated scrunch socks on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=scrunch socks)\n\n## Key Features Analysis\n\nThe scrunch sock market is surprisingly diverse, with brands offering a wide range of features to cater to different preferences.Understanding these technical specifications is crucial for making an informed purchase decision.**Material Composition:** Premium scrunch socks are frequently enough made from a blend of cotton, polyester, and spandex. The specific ratio of these materials impacts the sock's softness, durability, and stretch. High cotton content promotes breathability and moisture absorption, while polyester enhances resilience against wear and tear.A touch of spandex provides the necessary elasticity for the \"scrunch\" effect without excessive tightness.\n\n**Elasticity and Fit:** The elasticity of the sock's cuff is paramount. It needs to be strong enough to maintain the desired scrunch effect but gentle enough to avoid uncomfortable constriction around the calf. Premium socks utilize specialized elastic yarns and knitting techniques to achieve this balance. The fit should also be considered in relation to shoe size, ensuring that the foot portion of the sock isn't overly stretched or bunched up.\n\n**Knitting Density and Structure:** The density of the knit contributes significantly to the sock's overall quality and lifespan. A denser knit means more yarn per square inch, resulting in a thicker, more durable sock. Look for socks with reinforced heels and toes, as these areas are prone to wear and tear. The overall structure of the sock should provide adequate support without being too restrictive.\n\n**Colorfastness and Washability:** High-quality scrunch socks should retain their color even after multiple washes. Look for socks made with dyes that are resistant to fading and bleeding.The socks should also be machine washable and dryable for ease of care. It's always advisable to follow the manufacturer's care instructions to maximize the sock's lifespan and prevent shrinkage or damage.\n\nKey features of leading scrunch socks in 2025 include:\n\n*   Moisture-wicking fabrics\n*   reinforced heel and toe\n*   Comfortable elastic cuffs\n*   Variety of colors and patterns\n\n[[Explore Top Rated scrunch socks on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=scrunch socks)\n\n## Core Benefits\n\nScrunch socks offer a unique blend of style and functionality, providing several tangible benefits to the wearer.\n\n**Enhanced Comfort:** The relaxed fit and breathable materials of scrunch socks contribute significantly to overall comfort. Unlike tight, constricting socks, scrunch socks allow for better air circulation, reducing the risk of overheating and sweating. This is particularly beneficial during warmer months or for individuals who are prone to foot perspiration.\n\n**Stylish Versatility:** Scrunch socks are incredibly versatile and can be paired with a wide range of outfits. They add a touch of playful charm to casual looks, such as jeans and sneakers, and can also be dressed up with skirts or dresses. The variety of colors and patterns available allows for endless styling possibilities, enabling wearers to express their individual fashion sense.\n\n**Improved Circulation:** the looser fit of scrunch socks promotes better blood circulation in the legs and feet. This is especially beneficial for individuals who spend long periods standing or sitting, as it helps to prevent swelling and discomfort.

    "text": "Day 2/365 - DMX\nSong: X Gon’ Give It To Ya\n\nAffiliations: Murder Inc. (Group) Ruff Ryders (Group; somewhat)\n\nNotable Project(s): It’s Dark And Hell Is Hot, Flesh Of My Flesh Blood Of My Blood, …And Then There Was X, \n\nFollowing the deaths of 2Pac &amp; The Notorious  B.I.G., there were multiple rappers trying make a name for themselves as the next big thing. Following the year 1998, while there were many rappers who dropped instant classics such as Big Pun, OutKast, JAY-Z, &amp; Lauryn Hill, DMX is the one I believed to be the artist of the year. Not only did he drop the record, “It’s Dark And Hell Is Hot,” he also was able to release another classic within the same year being, “Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood.” Both records had huge success &amp; both debuted at Number 1 on the Billboard 100 upon respective releases. Key tracks/single from, “It’s Dark And Hell Is Hot,” consisted of, “Get At Me Dog,” “Stop Being Greedy,” &amp; of course, “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem,” which debuted which peaked at 93 on the Billboard once again. While “Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood,” had key tracks such as “Slippin,” “Dogs For Life,” &amp; “Bring Your Whole Crew.” Energy, aggression, &amp; charisma that DMX brought to the table couldn’t be matched up as he’s the definition &amp; embodiment of the phrase, “break sh*t.” Even then, aside from his ‘98 success, the hype didn’t stop there as he had even more tracks to have you jumping instead of bobbing your head to such as, “Get It On The Floor,” “Up In Here,” “Where The Hood At,” &amp; of course, “X Gon’ Give It To Ya.”\n\nHowever, not all DMX tracks will be an instant party jumping song. Being a devoted Christian he also made many deeper tracks that are even more emotional &amp; powerful considering the fact that DMX lost his life on April 9, 2021. Two of my personal favorite’s that I believe gets overlooked a lot are, “Let My Fly,” &amp; “The Rain.” And if it’s not either those two styles, he also proved to be an excellent storyteller. Some of my favorite comes his “Damien” trilogy. Most of his songs may be basic in terms of lyricism, however; DMX was always able to revert it into something more meaningful every time. “The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog. How you going if you’re living in the fog?” I like to use that bar a lot as a prime example. Regardless of which style DMX so chooses whenever he makes a song, he always brought the very best out of himself, &amp; made sure that we as fans had one hell of a time tuning into it.\n\nPROS: Dominated the late 90s, highly energetic &amp; charismatic persona, good storyteller, quickly able to immediately have the listener on his or her feet.\n\nCONS: When it comes to being a lyricist itself DMX doesn’t hold up as much as many other highly profound artists, 2010s run through his career was lackluster.\n\nR.I.P. DMX (1970-2021)",

    "text": "Hair Transplants: The Honest Truth – Pros, Cons, and Why Most People DON'T Regret It\nThinking about a hair transplant? You're not alone. This is one of the most significant decisions many people make on their journey to regaining confidence. At Vera Clinic, we've had the privilege of performing over 40,000 successful hair transplant procedures, welcoming patients from all corners of the globe. Through this extensive experience, we've heard every question and concern imaginable – from \"Will it look natural?\" to \"Is it truly worth the investment?\"\n\nTo help you make an informed decision, we've put together a **balanced and in-depth breakdown of the pros and cons** of hair transplantation. This isn't just marketing; it's based on extensive medical data, our expert surgeons' insights, and the real-world feedback from thousands of our patients.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n# THE UNDENIABLE PROS OF HAIR TRANSPLANTATION\n\n1. **Permanent, Natural, and Undetectable Results:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** This is the ultimate goal, and modern hair transplantation delivers. The transplanted hair follicles are typically harvested from the back or sides of your head – areas genetically programmed to resist pattern baldness. Once these follicles are successfully relocated to the thinning or bald areas and take root, they behave just like your original hair. They will grow, thicken, and can be cut, styled, and washed permanently. With advanced techniques like [**DHI (Direct Hair Implantation)**](https://www.veraclinic.net/dhi-hair-transplant/) and **Sapphire FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)**, surgeons have incredible control over the angle, direction, and density of implantation, ensuring the new hairline and density blend seamlessly with your existing hair. When done by a skilled hand, it's virtually impossible for anyone to tell you've had a procedure. It's *your* hair, just moved to a better location.\n   * **Vera Clinic Edge:** Our surgeons focus on artistic hairline design, ensuring a soft, natural transition that respects your facial structure and age, avoiding that \"pluggy\" or \"doll's head\" look associated with older techniques.\n2. **Profound Boost in Confidence and Quality of Life:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** The psychological impact of hair loss is often underestimated. For many, a receding hairline or thinning crown doesn't just change their appearance; it chips away at their self-esteem, makes them feel older, and can even affect social and professional interactions. Patients frequently report feeling years younger, more vibrant, and significantly more confident after their transplant. This newfound confidence often translates into improved social interactions, career opportunities, and an overall enhanced quality of life. It’s not just about hair; it’s about reclaiming a part of yourself.\n   * **Patient Insight:** We consistently hear feedback like, \"I finally feel like myself again,\" or \"I used to avoid photos, now I'm excited to pose.\"\n3. **Remarkably Low Maintenance Post-Recovery:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** Unlike ongoing topical treatments, special shampoos, or hair fibers that require daily application and continuous expenditure, transplanted hair is truly set-and-forget once it has fully grown in. You don't need to apply any special products specifically for the transplanted hair (though your surgeon might recommend general hair health supplements or DHT blockers for existing native hair). You can wash it, condition it, style it with gels or sprays, cut it short, or let it grow long – just like you always would. It becomes an effortless part of your natural appearance, liberating you from the daily worry of concealing hair loss.\n4. **Exceptional Success Rates with Modern Techniques:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** Hair transplant technology has come leaps and bounds. Gone are the days of outdated methods. Today, with techniques like **DHI** and **Sapphire FUE**, graft survival rates are incredibly high – consistently reported between **90-98%** when performed by highly experienced and specialized medical teams. This means the vast majority of the transplanted follicles will survive, thrive, and produce new, healthy hair. This high success rate offers peace of mind, knowing your investment is likely to yield impressive results.\n   * **Vera Clinic Edge:** Our meticulous approach and the use of highly advanced tools like sapphire blades and Choi implanter pens minimize trauma to the grafts, significantly contributing to our over 98% graft survival rate. We also incorporate advanced healing technologies like [**OxyCure™ therapy**](https://www.veraclinic.net/oxycure-therapy/), which enhances blood circulation and oxygen supply to the transplanted area, further boosting graft survival and accelerating healing.\n5. **A True One-Time (or Seldom) Investment:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** While the initial cost of a hair transplant might seem substantial, it's essential to view it as a long-term investment rather than an ongoing expense. Compare it to years of buying expensive hair loss shampoos, topical solutions (like minoxidil), oral medications (like finasteride), or temporary camouflage products (like hair fibers or wigs). Over a decade or two, the cumulative cost of these temporary solutions can easily surpass that of a single, permanent hair transplant. For many, the financial and emotional freedom from continuous hair loss management makes the upfront investment unequivocally worthwhile.\n   * **Cost-Effectiveness:** Especially when considering all-inclusive packages offered by leading clinics in Turkey, the value proposition is incredibly strong, making this permanent solution accessible to many more individuals.\n\n# THE REALISTIC CONS OF HAIR TRANSPLANTATION\n\n1. **The \"Shock Loss\" Phase Can Be Emotionally Challenging:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** This is perhaps the most significant emotional hurdle for patients. Approximately 2 to 4 weeks after your procedure, it's very common (and entirely normal!) for most of the newly transplanted hairs to shed. This \"shock loss\" happens because the follicles enter a resting phase due to the trauma of transplantation before they begin their new growth cycle. While temporary, seeing your newly transplanted hair fall out can be disconcerting and make you feel like the procedure failed.\n   * **Managing Expectations:** It's crucial to understand this is part of the natural process. At Vera Clinic, we meticulously prepare our patients for this phase, providing reassurance and reminding them that it's a positive sign that the follicles are resetting for new, permanent growth. New hair typically begins to emerge around months 3-4.\n2. **It IS a Surgical Procedure, Albeit Minimally Invasive:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** While a hair transplant is considered a minor outpatient surgery, it still involves local anesthesia, tiny incisions, and requires a sterile environment. Patients will experience mild discomfort during the initial anesthetic injections. Post-procedure, there will be some swelling (especially around the forehead and eyes for the first few days), redness, and small scabs forming in the recipient area. The donor area will also need to heal.\n   * **Recovery Timeline:** While most visible signs subside within 7-10 days (scabs fall off, redness fades), and you can typically return to light daily activities, it still requires following strict post-operative care instructions for the first two weeks (e.g., specific washing techniques, avoiding strenuous exercise, sleeping elevated). This isn't a \"lunchtime procedure\" – it requires dedication to the recovery protocol.\n3. **Cost Can Be a Significant Barrier in Certain Countries:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** This is a major factor driving medical tourism. In countries like the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe, a high-quality hair transplant can range from $10,000 to $30,000+ USD, making it financially prohibitive for many. This higher cost is due to vastly different healthcare systems, higher overheads, and higher labor costs.\n   * **The Turkey Advantage:** This is where Turkey shines. Thanks to its competitive market, lower operational costs, and established medical tourism infrastructure, the same high-quality procedure at a clinic like [Vera Clinic](https://www.veraclinic.net/) often utilizing superior techniques, can cost 3-4 times less. This affordability makes the life-changing procedure accessible without compromising on safety or results.\n4. **Not Every Individual is an Ideal Candidate, or May Require Multiple Sessions:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** Hair transplantation isn't a magic bullet for everyone. The success of a transplant relies heavily on the quality and quantity of your donor hair (the healthy, permanent follicles available for transplantation). If you have very advanced hair loss (e.g., Norwood 6 or 7) with a severely depleted or very thin donor area, achieving full, dense coverage might be challenging or impossible in a single session. Some individuals may benefit from multiple sessions spaced out over time, while others with very limited donor supply might not be suitable candidates without adjunctive treatments.\n   * **Vera Clinic's Approach:** We conduct thorough, honest consultations. Our priority is realistic expectations and ethical practice. If a transplant isn't the best solution for you, or if you might benefit from **supportive treatments like PRP, stem cell therapy, or exosome therapy** to maximize existing hair health or prepare your scalp, we will advise you accordingly. We never over-harvest the donor area, as this can lead to permanent damage.\n5. **Results Demand Patience – It's a Long Game, Not an Instant Fix:**\n   * **Deeper Dive:** This is perhaps the hardest \"con\" for many: the time commitment. While the procedure itself is over in a day, the full results take time – typically **6 to 12 months, and sometimes up to 18 months**, for the transplanted hairs to fully mature, thicken, and blend seamlessly. You won't walk out of the clinic with a full head of hair. The visible changes are gradual. This requires patience, trust in the process, and understanding that good things take time. It's a journey, not a sprint.\n\n# So, Do Most People Regret Getting a Hair Transplant?\n\nIn our extensive experience, and looking at the vast majority of our 40,000+ patients: **Absolutely not.** The overwhelming majority of individuals who undergo a hair transplant, especially when performed by a reputable clinic with realistic expectations, are incredibly happy with their decision and their results.\n\n**Regret almost universally stems from a few common pitfalls:**\n\n* **Choosing Unlicensed, Unqualified, or \"Bargain-Basement\" Clinics:** Sadly, the booming industry in Turkey has led to some unethical practices. Choosing a clinic solely based on the lowest price, without verifying surgeon credentials, facility standards, or patient reviews, is the primary source of regret. These clinics often cut corners on hygiene, use inexperienced technicians, or over-harvest donor areas, leading to poor results, infections, or permanent damage.\n* **Poor Communication or Lack of Aftercare:** A good clinic provides comprehensive post-operative instructions and continuous support. Patients who don't receive this vital guidance or who feel abandoned post-procedure are more likely to have issues or feel dissatisfied.\n* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Believing a transplant will give you the same hairline you had as a teenager when you're 40 with significant balding is unrealistic. Chasing an \"Instagram perfect\" density that doesn't align with your donor supply can lead to disappointment.\n* **Neglecting Post-Op Instructions:** Not following the recovery protocol (e.g., picking scabs, exposing scalp to sun, strenuous activity too early) can compromise graft survival and overall results.\n\nIf hair loss is impacting your confidence, your social life, or simply making you feel less like yourself, a hair transplant can truly be a life-changing decision. But like any significant medical procedure, it should be made with careful consideration, thorough research, and the right team by your side. Choose wisely, set realistic expectations, and trust the process.\n\nStill unsure or have specific questions about your situation? Ask us anything in the comments below!

    "text": "White Scrunch Leggings Review: Do They Actually Lift Your Booty?\nOkay, real talk about leggings, y'all. 😅\n\nI've been on the hunt for the perfect pair for… well, longer than I care to admit. You know how it is. Some are comfy but offer zero support. Others feel like you're wearing a sausage casing all day. And don’t even get me started on the see-through nightmares. 🙈\n\nLately, I've been trying out these white scrunch leggings. Now, I know what you're thinking: white leggings? Are you crazy? Hear me out. The big thing is the scrunch detail on the back. It’s supposed to give your booty a little… lift. I was super skeptical, but honestly? It actually works. Like, noticeably.\n\nI'm no expert, but I've tried enough leggings to know a thing or two. The fabric is a nylon/spandex blend. What that means is they're stretchy but also hold their shape. Important for white leggings, trust me. They’re also high-waisted, which I love because I feel like it sucks everything in without being too constricting. The seamless design is a game changer too. No weird lines or chafing, even when I’m doing a longer workout.\n\nI’ve been wearing them for everything – yoga, running, even just chilling around the house. The moisture-wicking fabric is nice because, let's be honest, no one wants to walk around with sweat stains. 😅\n\nNow, are these magic? No. They're not going to give you a completely different body. But they do enhance what you've already got. I feel more confident wearing them, which is a win in my book. I think the \"booty lifting scrunch\" is the key feature that makes them different from other leggings. A lot of companies make similar claims, but these really seem to deliver, visually.\n\nI was looking at some other brands, and I noticed a lot of them focus on just being comfortable. Which is great, but I want something that looks good too, you know? These leggings seem to hit that sweet spot of comfort and style.\n\nHonestly, it solves a problem I think a lot of us face: wanting to feel good about ourselves when we're working out or just running errands. It's not about changing who you are, but about feeling confident in what you're wearing.\n\nOne thing I will say is that finding the right size is crucial. Too small, and they'll be uncomfortable and unflattering. Too big, and you lose the benefits of the compression. Definitely check the size chart before ordering. Also, because they're white, you’ll probably want to wear nude underwear to avoid any visibility issues. Just sayin’. 😉\n\nI saw these leggings on ursupermart.com, and they had a bunch of different sizes.\n\nSo, are they worth it? For me, yes. They've become a staple in my workout wardrobe. If you're curious, maybe give them a look. Just remember, everyone's body is different, so what works for me might not work for you.\n\nHave you guys tried scrunch leggings before? What are your favorite brands? I'm always looking for new recommendations! Let’s chat in the comments! 👇\n\nhttps://ursupermart.com/products/white-scrunch-butt-leggings-for-women",

WHY do people buy a shirt or a dress, throw it in a wrinkled heap on their couch or bed, take the WORST, most blurry picture imaginable, and then post it like, “Hope this helps!” NO. IT DOES NOT HELP. \n\nIt’s literally just a lumpy pile of fabric. How am I supposed to know what it actually looks like?!\n\nLay it flat. Hang it up. PUT IT ON YOUR BODY.

    "text": "Tracey Emin’s Bed\nThe big comedy punchline this week was clearly based on this artwork, Tracey Emin’s bed, created in 1999, not ‘the 80s’. \n\nHer crumbled tights, the cigarettes, period stained clothes, the pregnancy tests, lube; it revealed unprecedented feminine grime- confessional and vulnerable. Created to commemorate her physical and mental state after a long depressive episode, Emin literally stripped herself bare creating a new self-portrait. She is missing from the space, yet, she is everywhere.\n\nStanding in front of it was a deeply affecting experience. Her intimate space, ravaged and raw; humiliating, lonely, her fragility exposed. It felt entirely personal, too personal, too much, but also universal, touching a part inside we didn’t talk about then. And completely taboo. \n\nLargely thanks to SATC, sex was finally starting to become part of the female conversation in 1999, but this was different. It wasn’t glamorous or sexy. It wasn’t heels and cocktails and palatable to men. It was visceral and animalistic and desperate. A different, equally valid expression of what it is to be a woman but much less celebrated.\n\nNowadays, people wear their differences like badges of honour. How many influencers define themselves by their neurodivergence or mental illness first? In a land of diminishing community, people are forging identities and connection on the things her generation were trained to keep hidden. \n\nHow quickly we seem to have forgotten how revolting her work was to Emin’s contemporaneous world, how shocking. When ‘The Bed’ was nominated for the Turner Prize, it caused an absolute media storm. Emin was derided and humiliated worldwide. Talentless. Garbage. Not art. Dirty bitch.. She was dehumanised for daring to reveal her humanity. \n\nNot only was the work of art an act of humility and bravery in itself but so was surviving the landslide of abuse afterwards. But, Emin’s brilliance was in her defiance and she stood, chin out, and unapologetic. Her work, a snarling bite back at the male gaze, having painted women in their beds for a millennia, she said, you want our beds? You want our sex? Here it is. Here is what we don’t let you see. What you have trained us to be afraid of and ashamed by. Look at it.\n\nWhether you like her work or not, it had real teeth. \n\nPlacing a naked body in this sacred, haunted space, for yuck yucks is so cheap and deeply misogynistic. Look at silly women feeling sad. Laugh at her bum. Ha ha ha.\n\nIt is a seminal piece and if those three dopey gallerinas need Charlotte to explain that to them, quite frankly, they should scrunch up their degrees and throw them into the detritus that surrounds the installation because they are not worth the paper they are printed on.\n\nAnd, I’m sorry fellow millenials, the Lena Dunham reference in the episode annoyed me.. not to diminish her accomplishments but her experiences next to Emin’s are incomparable. \n\nDunham was a coddled and spoilt and celebrated and adored child, an artist’s nepo baby. She was raised in a multimillion dollar apartment in New York, groomed to express herself and dress as drag queens for school dress up days (by her own admission). There was no financial risk for her to explore her art as her family money and connections were a nice cushy safety blanket. She also lived in a world post-Emin, where the punch had already been spiked. \n\nEmin, raped at 13. Abortion at 18. Fractious family life. A descendent of slaves. She grew up in poverty, her father splitting his time between two families he failed to support. It was infinitely harder for Emin’s voice to be heard. Infinitely riskier to Emin to challenge society’s expectations so firmly. Yet she did it.\n\nAnyway. I just love this artwork and if anyone else wasn’t familiar, I wanted to share a bit of the wider context.",

    "text": "Schecter Sunset-7 Red Dawn Review\n**Here is my review of the Sunset-7 Red Dawn.**  \nFeel free to ask me any questions. I'm writing this because the guitar is relatively new, and I couldn't find many reviews on it.\n\n# Initial Impressions\n\nI've been playing this guitar for a couple of weeks now, and I have to say—it’s awesome. Taking it out of the box, it was packaged very well. The only thing I was a little disappointed about is that a hard case isn’t included at this price point. I did end up buying the case, and I have to say it's really nice and fits perfectly.\n\nThe guitar was set up perfectly—I haven’t had to adjust much at all.\n\n# Evertune or No Evertune\n\nI initially ordered the guitar with the Evertune bridge, but I was mistakenly sent the standard string-through version. The company I ordered from gave me a generous discount, making it much cheaper than usual, so I decided to keep it.\n\nLet me say—compared to my Solar with an Evertune—I haven’t noticed much of a difference in tuning stability that would make me say you *absolutely need* the Evertune bridge.\n\n# Tone\n\nI primarily use a Kemper, usually with some variation of a 5150 profile, and I have to say the pickups are very clear and sound great! Compared to my Solar guitar, which has Bare Knuckle Juggernauts installed, this guitar cuts through the mix better and just sounds more \"HD\" to me.\n\nI know everyone’s setup is different, but in my experience, the stock pickups in this guitar are fantastic.\n\n# Scale Length\n\nThis is my first 27\" guitar. My other guitar is 26.5\". It takes a little getting used to—I play in Drop A—but I’m starting to really favor the extra tension more than I expected. I do wish they offered this guitar in different scale lengths. I took a chance on the 27\", and I ended up liking it, but you might find it a bit large depending on your tuning or string preferences.\n\n# Neck Dive\n\nIt has a slight neck dive, but nothing major. When standing, it’s not an issue. While sitting, you *might* experience a little, depending on how you’re holding it, but personally, I haven’t had a problem. If you get the model with the Evertune, I think that would eliminate it entirely.\n\n# Weight\n\nThis thing is light—especially for a 7-string. I have zero complaints. If you're used to something heavy like a Les Paul, this will feel noticeably lighter.\n\n# Neck\n\nIt’s thin! Which is exactly what I wanted. Just be aware that it doesn’t have much roundness to it, so depending on your playing style, your mileage may vary. I really like it—it’s super fast. Perfect for what it is.\n\nI can't really think of much else to say about the guitar other than: I really like it. I just wish they offered different scale lengths and included a case.",

    "text": "Tomtoc Navigator-T67 Backpack Review — Honest Pros &amp; Cons for Travel\nIf you're looking for a durable, affordable travel laptop backpack, the Tomtoc Navigator-T67 is worth a close look. It’s often compared to its sibling, the T66, but has some subtle yet meaningful differences that could tip the scales depending on your travel style.\n\n[The Tomtoc T67 is a durable and affordable travel backpack.](https://preview.redd.it/6yeqyy46pvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cd219d8db6d627157d883a64340f2e8208561fe)\n\n# What Stands Out:\n\n* Durable and rugged build: Made from 1680D ballistic nylon, the T67 offers great abrasion resistance and some water resistance, giving it a tough, tactical travel aesthetic.\n* Comfort-focused harness system: The shoulder straps are thick and well-padded, paired with a plush back panel and adjustable sternum strap, making it feel like a mattress on your back during longer treks.\n* Functional compression straps: Four compression straps help cinch down the bag for carry-on compliance or secure external gear like water bottles, adding versatility.\n* Laptop compartment with premium features: YKK lockable zippers, microfiber lining to prevent scratches, and room for up to a 17-inch laptop make this an excellent tech protector at this price point.\n\n[Close-up of the durable 1680D balistic nylon primary material and subdued logo.](https://preview.redd.it/cvheyaiapvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b27c7a7d015ff3feee3084debff5aec13bb97b4)\n\n[The T67 features very beefy and comfortable shoulder straps.](https://preview.redd.it/iu6slfcfpvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b45f3463a085937d85fbe444a06a2b14c94416)\n\n[The T67's laptop compartment feels very premium and can hold up to a 17\\\\\" laptop.](https://preview.redd.it/d3nms4xlpvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813cb3cfe0a7581b6989f4cb21be67ae73e35210)\n\n# What Could Be Better:\n\n* Compression straps can be a nuisance: While versatile, the straps often get in the way when opening the main compartment and can feel cumbersome over time.\n* Doesn’t self-stand reliably: Despite a plastic base insert meant for structure, the bag struggles to stand upright when packed, which can be frustrating when on the go.\n* Luggage pass-through is tight: The sleeve for securing the backpack to rolling luggage is a bit snug and scrunches the bag, making it awkward to slide on and off.\n\n[The compression straps are a nice addition to compress the bag a bit, but can get in the way of opening the main compartment.](https://preview.redd.it/k28ukutrpvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5cd5005a7a1fbda874f57cf8f2560b9fc3e5c9)\n\n[The luggage pass-through is on the tighter side, making it awkward to use.](https://preview.redd.it/5kqmxm41qvcf1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d97380b4a542be811f37d5a95d75887461830c3)\n\n# Final Take:\n\nThe Tomtoc Navigator-T67 delivers outstanding value for travelers looking for a rugged, comfortable backpack that won’t break the bank. Its durability and laptop protection stand out for the price, and the harness system caters well to those who prefer a beefier, more supportive carry. However, if you’re sensitive to bulky straps or want a bag that self-stands effortlessly, you might find some drawbacks here. Compared to the T66 sibling, the T67 leans into simplicity and a slightly smaller size, with a lighter lining and some handy zippered pockets replacing one water bottle slot.\n\nIf you want alternatives, check out the Osprey Daylite 26 + 6 for expandable capacity or the Aer Travel Pack 3 for elevated materials and refined construction at a higher price point. Each of these bags offers a unique set of strengths depending on your specific travel needs.\n\nWatch our full review: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERzZ6nc9mwA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERzZ6nc9mwA)\n\nWhat do you think of the Tomtoc Navigator-T67? 👇",

We did a meet and greet, I liked her. She has 8 5-star reviews over the last year and a half, with the last several months of verified stays. Booked through Rover. We did exchange Whatsapp numbers because I am out of the country on this trip and do not have an international calling plan.\n\nShe sent messages the first few days. \nWednesday at 3am she sent a message that she had been sick with a stomach bug, but was feeling better. She asked a question about one dogs behavior (sitting in the bathroom barking), and I responded (she probably wants fresh water, she's asking to drink from the toilet). I didn't hear anything so I sent several messages checking in, on Whatsapp and Rover. No response. I checked my smart lock on my door and there was very minimal locking and unlocking, and always from the inside. \nI checked my camera outside that door. \nMy dogs happened to be outside so I watched them. Then you hear a man (a man I don't know) say \"okay one last shot\". Then the man whistles for the dogs to come inside, and she wobbles into the door way. They walk out and she falls over and he catches her. They leave together in, I assume, his vehicle. She was barefoot and obviously heavily intoxicated. That was 4pm Thursday.\n\nI sent my friend over around midnight to check on the dogs and let them out. She found my bottles of liquor, now empty, all over the dining table (they were all either brand new or over half full), a handful of my truly seltzers empty and in the trash, a container of cratum on the table and several more in the trash. A couple empty bottles of a THC drink, with more in the fridge, that are not mine. A weed vape pen on the table. Loose pills in the bottom of her purse - methocarbamol 500mg. That matches a prescription my dog has but she had more than what my dog was prescribed, so either none or only some were stolen from my dog. My boxes where I keep medications were taken down from the cabinet in the bathroom and set on the counter and back of the toilet. I won't know if any are missing until I get home, but I have the things worth stealing with me. \nThe toilet was clogged. The second toilet has a towel under it like it was leaking, which it has never done before.\n\nMy dogs free feed - I keep food in their bowls at all times. Both bowls were empty. \nTheir water (a 2 gallon bowl with fountain) was empty. My friend put 2.5 cups of food in both bowls and they immediately ate all of it. Then she put another 5 cups in both bowls and they kept eating. They never do this so they hadn't been fed in a long time.\n\nThank you for reading this far. I want to know, what is every single step I should take next? I have already made a report to Rover. I can't call their number until I am back in the country at my layover around 6:30pm today. I sent them all the pictures from my friend and the video from my camera of her falling over. They are sending it to their trust and safety team and said I should get a response within 24 hours. They have offered no alternatives to pet care in the mean time.\n\nMy friend spoke with the police and they said her stuff is abandoned property so have her car towed and do whatever with her things inside my house. If she comes back, I can keep her stuff until I am home and make sure she only leaves with her things. I have deactivated her door code so it won't work and all doors are locked, but I will see if she attempts to come back and use her code. Her car is still in my driveway. My friend peeked inside and saw synthetic urine inside. I have not had any communication since the message Wednesday.\n\nHow much liability is on Rover?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Bulky-District-2757**\n\n&gt;This is insane! I’d imagine rover will refund you and then ban the sitter.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I do also feel like that much is guaranteed. I am not sure about the several hundred dollars in alcohol she consumed. Is that a civil suit? Can I even get her info from Rover to be able to file that? And I have no idea the cost of the toilet repair.\n\n**~**\n\n**scoutydouty**\n\n&gt;Hey, so, she got really fucked up, and a man came and took her away? And she never returned for her CAR or any of her stuff?? \n\n&gt;Am I the only one actually concerned for this sitter's wellbeing? What if she's been kidnapped? Raped? She had good reviews and 1.5 years of them to boot, this is really, abnormal behavior from what I can see.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;She definitely knew the man who showed up. He seemed concerned when he first got there and he stayed for a while before they left together. He was helping her to the car. It seemed like he came to help.\n\n**OOP added in the comments**\n\n&gt;I was also wondering how someone with this level of addiction could have passed the background check. I have her last name because she has business cards in her purse, and a vague address from the Rover profile.\n\n**annaxdee**\n\n&gt;&gt;None of the substances that were being used are illegal so as long as the sitter hasn’t committed a crime adject to addiction (theft, DUI, etc.), there is no reason why they would not pass a background check. \n\n&gt;&gt;Sounds like the sitter is smart enough to have a designated driver if they left their vehicle in OP’s driveway. However it sounds like their sticky finger will eventually land them a theft charge. \n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Well it's theft now. All the liquor bottles were mine, and the seltzers.\n\n**Mini update in the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/s/imJuVZKvja)**\n\nGeneral updates after going through my whole house: \n\nThere were methocarbamol pills scattered everywhere throughout her things, as well as a few Sudafed, amoxicillin, another vape, and many many many of those little bottles of kratom. Inside her box of cosmetics. Inside her box of yarn and crochet supplies. Inside multiple pockets of her purse. I threw away all of it. \n\nShe has a prescription bottle for sertraline. It was on the floor in a bag and thank gods my dogs didn't get into it. \n\nMy custom built gaming table, the floor under it, and the chair that was on that end of the table are all incredibly sticky and nasty. \n\nMultiple towels were in the washing machine. The towel on the floor of the spare bath smells like shit. So did her clothes in the spare room. The main bath was clogged because the tank was empty, because the water was shut off. It appears to be flushing now. Hopefully that's functional. The toilet is stinky and nasty. The spare bath is stinky. \n\nThe dogs were happy to see me. I brought them chicken nuggets. I turned my back and Ginny ate half my burger bun too, the counter surfing goon. Both are currently napping, on either side of me. \n\nI will investigate the yard in the morning given that I found some empty truly cans and a cigarette bud in the front porch. \n\nHer car is still out front. It's parked entirely off the street with all 4 wheels in the grass between my yard and my neighbors yard. \n\nI am still going through all the camera footage. There is more. The man was there longer and she stumbled INTO the house at 9am Wednesday. I think they were gone all Tuesday night. I will update once I can finish reviewing all that.\n\nNo new responses from Rover. \n\nThank you everyone for the warmth and support and advice. I will continue to keep everyone updated via this thread.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1k07i0o/update_sitter_drank_all_my_alcohol_then_abandoned/)  **Apr 16, 2025 (5 days later)**\n\n[The empty bottles](https://imgur.com/a/ZqCZdFR)\n\nI finished reviewing all the camera footage. It took most of the Saturday and Sunday after arriving home. The sitter arrived at my home at 10:30am Saturday (I hadn't requested her to start until the afternoon, but she said she happened to be off work so would show up early). She started drinking the seltzers on the front porch at 11:00am that day. She notices the camera and tries to hide the cans in her dress as she drinks them outside Saturday and Sunday. She also smokes outside those days. I found an empty HHC sativa cigarette box, and saw her bring that into the house, plus found a lighter - I assume that's what she was smoking.\n\nHer boyfriend starts showing up on Tuesday and shows up every day after that, usually twice a day. I've never met him and never agreed to allow him in my house. She appears drunk while leaving Tuesday at 6:30pm, and no one returns until she comes back Wednesday at 8:30am, also stumbling. She sent me an update at 3:30am (while not even at my house) to say she had a stomach bug and ask about my one dog barking in the bathroom (I responded saying she was asking for water). That was the last communication I had from her until Friday morning, when her BF tried to get into the house with her code. I sent several messages and requests for updates, via Rover and WhatsApp, but didn't hear back.\n\nThe first time the door opens on Thursday is at 3:45pm when her boyfriend shows up. It's possible she let the dogs out in the back yard, but until then they had been going out the side door (with the camera) quite often, so I suspect they weren't let out at all that day. Watching the full video, her BF has a moment of breaking down crying (facing the outdoor camera with his back to her) after finding her, so I don't think he was encouraging her to drink. His full comment, after listening very closely, is \"take one last shot and then we'll go\" and there's another, quieter, \"we gotta get outta here\". I think he was just trying to convince her to leave. I do think it's possible she was actually in the hospital. I never saw anyone else show up to the house, so given how much she drank, she absolutely should have been in the hospital.\n\nIn general, the videos were a lot of just the dogs being outside, barking to come in, wandering around, and Ginny begging for someone to throw her Frisbee. It was so hard to watch them be ignored like that. I feel guilty for not keeping a closer eye on my camera. I normally watch the door locking and unlocking, and use that to check the camera, but she wasn't locking it, even over night or when she left the house. I know I wouldn't have caught the early signs of drinking the seltzers unless I was watching every single video, but I am feeling the parent guilt over everything my babies went through.\n\nI have written out a full timeline of events, saved all relevant videos, saved screenshots of all conversations on WhatsApp and Rover, printed all emails with Rover, included a copy of my dog sitting instructions, and collected every photo from myself and my friends. I updated the itemized list to include the actual amount of time my friends spent here, screenshots of uber costs, and things like that, plus court costs. I ordered all photos to be printed to bring to court. I'm not sure how to share the videos other than bring my tablet to court, but I took the most damning screenshot from every video and added that to the printed photos. I officially filed paperwork for a civil suit against her, and the sheriff has everything to serve her. After double checking all the costs of everything, getting the total from the house keeper, and adding in court-related costs, I am suing for $1,124. If all goes well, court will be mid-May.\n\nI searched public records in my area for her, and she has no record (for crimes or probation) that I could find. I am guessing the synthetic urine was to pass a drug screen for work.\n\nI was able to get a house keeper to come Monday to help with the sticky mess and gross bathrooms. I've been doing laundry for days, in between all the documentation. Everything in my house feels gross and violated.\n\nThe pups are acting relatively normal, maybe little more tired than usual. The independent hound dog is definitely clingier than usual, and actually listening when I tell her to come. The Carolina dog couldn't possibly get more clingy than she already was, and she's acting perfectly normal. I took them on a car ride with me to get food because I couldn't bear to leave them, and they got spoiled with some chicken nuggets. They are getting extra treats and love. The vet said that after 6 days without it, the Prozac is basically out of Ginny's system and it could take another 6-8 weeks to see full effects again. There is also a chance it will not work at all anymore after suddenly stopping it. So far it does seem she is calmer so I'm hoping she is feeling better to be back on it and home safe with momma.\n\nAttached is the full-res original image from my friend for the haters.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Supercrushhh**\n\n&gt;I’ve been waiting for this update! I cannot imagine how someone could do this while responsible for someone else’s babies / in another person’s home. I wish you all the best with your case and hope to get more updates! Has the sitter said anything else to you?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Not sure if you read all the updates on the other post ... So she apologized for making me uncomfortable and leaving my house a mess and said she hadn't drank in 9 years. Then threatened me for keeping her things. I said that her things were in her car and it had been towed, and if she wanted to settle things out of court, here is the itemized list. I listed out all the alcohol, cleaning fees, and extra sitters for 3 check ins after she left. She said she'll have her lawyer call me and \"this is a cease and desist\". I haven't heard anything from her since then.\n\n**When discussing what costs to add to the civil suit**\n\n**MindOverEntropy**\n\n&gt;Your time cleaning, vet costs and time should also be included. I hope they were.\n\n**Prior_Talk_7726**\n\n&gt;&gt;And you said you hired a house cleaner.  Include that too\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I included the house cleaner with a receipt signed by both of us. I haven't included my time spent cleaning. I can bring that up in court and see what they say.\n\n**shrinkingnadia**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And the time your friend took to go over and check things out.  Also consider a lawyer.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, I included Uber for friends and the time they spent there for the 3 check ins until I could get home.\n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/s/rHPMK5jEcG)  **July 2, 2025**\n\n[More pics of the empties](https://imgur.com/a/oO444HD)\n\nI showed up at the most recent court date. I tried to have the sheriff serve her, paperwork returned as multiple failed attempts. I sent certified mail to her home, returned undeliverable. I sent certified mail to her business and someone (not her) signed for it, and that was then returned to the court as well. The judge said that I have to continue to attempt, and they cannot hear the case until she is served. My only allowed options for serving her are via sheriff or certified mail.\n\nSo, I need help - how do I find her and get her served? The sheriff and post office left notes that they attempted to reach her so she knows I'm after her.\n\nI have the following information on her, because of everything she left in my house (which has since been returned): Full name, address at the time of events, her frequently-used username (from her cash app credit card), her social security number (her card was in her things), current and former drivers license, her past work places (business cards), and her now-expired car dealership seller license number (it's not searchable unfortunately). I've found her Facebook page (minimal public info), instagram (barely used), and reddit account (frequently used, but nothing on this subreddit).\n\nBased on what I have, it looks like she moved to another city 2.5 hours away, but in the same state. I'm not sure if it's allowed to post the state, but that's super relevant because legal issues vary so wildly from state to state, so I'll put it in a comment in case that needs deleted!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**the state**\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;If allowed - the state is NC.\n\n**Why not hire someone to serve her?**\n\n&gt;Hilarious!!! Individuals aren't allowed to serve in my state unfortunately, or I would absolutely be down for such antics.\n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

From top to bottom, Kojima Productions made so many improvements to the original, making a weird delivery-sim game that is quite relaxing. Those improvements may not be enough to attract people who avoided the original, yet the players coming back are going to find a sense of calmness that you could assume Kojima wanted to deliver with his game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Rhett Waselenchuk](https://opencritic.com/critic/6383/rhett-waselenchuk) - [100 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/1992889-death-stranding-2-review-norman-reedus-leads-sequel)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is yet another stellar entry from one of gaming’s greatest minds. The whole team at Kojima Productions has delivered a startling project that is massive in scale, building upon the original’s mechanics in interesting ways.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a bigger and bolder expansion that will once again split fans and critics. The improvements across the board are felt immediately, bringing about a significant amount of much-needed change to the formula. Between the changes to stealth and combat, the new structures you can build, and the new settings, cast, and music, Death Stranding 2 has proven that Kojima is not only on point but also an auteur of the industry. There is nobody like him doing what he does, and I sincerely doubt there will be.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Brad Norton](https://opencritic.com/critic/9300/brad-norton) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-review-3216620/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 is phenomenal. It’s among Kojima’s very best work not just for its narrative, but for the near-limitless variety in its gameplay opportunities.\n&gt;\n&gt;While it may very well end up being the final game in the series, at least with Kojima at the helm, we can only hope someone else picks up the mantle and continues to iterate on one of gaming’s most unique experiences.

Even if Death Stranding 2: On the Beach didn’t grip me at first as I had hoped, by the end — much like its predecessor — it left me deeply moved and with a strange, immediate sense of longing. Just hours after finishing it, I started it all over again — not out of a need for completion (which I could have continued from my first run), but simply because I still can’t bring myself to leave this world and these characters. To me, this rare kind of involvement — at once interactive, emotional, and philosophical — is what makes video games such a special form of expression.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Enternity.gr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/783/enternity-gr)** - [Panagiotis Petropoulos](https://opencritic.com/critic/7436/panagiotis-petropoulos) - *Greek* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.enternity.gr/Article/Games/Reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/95785.html)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is better than its predecessor in almost all areas, placing a heavy emphasis on combat while keeping the stealth feature at a very good level.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Sebastian Kasparek](https://opencritic.com/critic/3746/sebastian-kasparek) - *Polish* - [10 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-przeszedl-samego-siebie-i/z64738)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 doesn't have to be perfect, but it is exceptional as a game and a sequel. It's hard for me to point out any real flaws. I played like a haunted person, looking forward to the next scenes. This is a complete experience - much bigger, better, more dynamic, much more interestingly conceived and varied compared to the previous installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Diego Nicolás Argüello](https://opencritic.com/critic/4378/diego-nicol-s-arg-ello) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is fixated on revisiting past ideas, which limits its impact to being a good but not great sequel\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamersky](https://opencritic.com/outlet/597/gamersky)** - [心灵奇兵](https://opencritic.com/critic/8660/-) - *Chinese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gamersky.com/news/202506/1948857.shtml)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach feels more like a purposeful yet uncertain journey into uncharted territory. Building upon the core mechanics of its predecessor, it makes the delivery process less hardcore, offering richer possibilities in both combat and stealth. The series' iconic \"delivery\" is not just an activity, but central to its narrative. If you still believe that \"connections\" between people hold meaning, then Death Stranding 2 is a journey worth taking.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Nexus](https://opencritic.com/outlet/104/gaming-nexus)** - [Jason Dailey](https://opencritic.com/critic/9502/jason-dailey) - [10 / 10](https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/16229/Death-Stranding-2-On-the-Beach/)\n\n&gt;Hideo Kojima once again proves to be a singular creative force in the video game industry, crafting a sequel in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach that is not just essential for fans of the first game, but an essential experience for all gamers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Shubhankar Parijat](https://opencritic.com/critic/1198/shubhankar-parijat) - [10 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-a-bigger-better-sequel)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 delivers stunning visuals, refined stealth-focused gameplay, and a richly detailed world brought to life by excellent audio and a memorable cast. It meaningfully evolves the original's mechanics, though its unique style will still divide fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [82 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/death-stranding-2-the-beach-229922/)\n\n&gt;A true cargo-carrying experience: it's not all that fun at the beginning of the trip, it gets better once you warm up, and provides the best feeling when you finally get rid of everything that's been weighing down your back.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INDIANTVCZ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/684/indiantvcz)** - [Filip Kraucher](https://opencritic.com/critic/6044/filip-kraucher) - *Czech* - [7 / 10](https://indian-tv.cz/recenze/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-ldli2t#comments)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 is a fascinating yet conflicted sequel. Unafraid to slow down, reflect, and stir emotion, but too often at the cost of frustration and recycled mechanics. It refuses to pander, save for the promise of story continuation, stellar cast, and an evocative soundtrack. But before expanding its world, it should have focused more deeply on refining its gameplay, because the magic of the first game can’t be relived twice.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [9 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=306885)\n\n&gt;Compared to its predecessor, Death Stranding 2 delivers a far more refined experience in every aspect—from gameplay to narrative pacing. The stunning visual presentation and tightly directed storytelling keep you engaged right up to the end. While the repetitive gameplay may cause a brief sense of fatigue in the middle, the powerful climax makes it all worthwhile.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [90 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/06/death-stranding-2-review/)\n\n&gt;My 35+ hours with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was laced with so many emotions and feelings: boredom, excitement, joy, confusion, and satisfaction. It still has the trademarks of a Kojima-written narrative -\"Muffin Man\"-style dialogue, bats*** insane moments, subtle-as-a-sledgehammer storytelling with obvious symbolism. \n&gt;\n&gt;But that's what makes this sequel all the more endearing; you may cringe at some moments, but you won't be bored with the thread being spun here. Nor will you be left out of the lurch with the interactive experience you're getting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[KonsoliFIN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/942/konsolifin)** - [Niko Lähteenmäki](https://opencritic.com/critic/11052/niko-l-hteenm-ki) - *Finnish* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.konsolifin.net/arvostelu/jatko-osa-joka-tekee-kaikkensa-voittaakseen-vihaajat-puolelleen-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is, in my book, a near-perfect sequel. Many of the criticisms aimed at the first game have been addressed with smart changes that make it significantly more approachable. Visually and aurally, it’s even more stunning than its predecessor, and the new plot twists are truly gripping. Only the masochists who loved the utter bleakness of the first game might not appreciate the improvements that Kojima Productions has made.\n\n-------------\n\n**[LevelUp](https://opencritic.com/outlet/454/levelup)** - *Spanish* - [Unscored](https://www.levelup.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/)\n\n&gt;It's a video game, but also an experience that stimulates all your senses; a work capable of stirring emotions and surprisingly discovering that gaming can be just as moving as a song, a play, or a movie. As a game, it meets and surpasses its predecessor; as a creative expression, it reaffirms the talent of Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, as well as their stubbornness to continue innovating and pushing the boundaries of the medium. It's not perfect; it slips in places, but it's undoubtedly one of the best games of the year.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Chris White](https://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white) - [10 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is one of the greatest games of all time, blending freedom in its gameplay with a story and soundtrack that will be remembered for decades.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Merlin'in Kazanı](https://opencritic.com/outlet/661/merlinin-kazan-)** - [Samet Basri Taşlı](https://opencritic.com/critic/6959/samet-basri-ta-l-) - *Turkish* - [87 / 100](https://www.merlininkazani.com/Death_Stranding_2-oyun_inceleme-129036p1.html)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has managed to be a beautiful game that will make fans of the first game very happy with its rich cast, magnificent music and eccentric humor.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Sam Aberdeen](https://opencritic.com/critic/4725/sam-aberdeen) - [10 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach.html)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is one of the best games of the generation and Kojima Productions at the peak of its craft - so precisely fine-tuned, emotionally resonant and at times, completely and confidently bonkers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) - [9 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/06/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach builds meaningfully upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, delivering a more dynamic and visually arresting sequel anchored by an emotional narrative that doesn't let go until the finish. It invites returning porters and newcomers alike to rediscover its strange, beautiful world with a renewed sense of wonder, reminding us that Kojima magic is very much alive.\n&gt;\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is absolutely essential and a must-play title that could easily get Game of the Year nods yet again. Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have delivered a unique and gripping experience, guiding us through the wilderness and reminding us that every step, no matter how uncertain, brings us closer to connection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Oyungezer Online](https://opencritic.com/outlet/487/oyungezer-online)** - [Eren Eryürekli](https://opencritic.com/critic/8570/eren-ery-rekli) - *Turkish* - [9 / 10](https://oyungezer.com.tr/inceleme/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-inceleme)\n\n&gt;Kojima has once again managed to deliver an emotional and deeply layered story that will have us trekking through mountains and valleys for 90 hours - it simply doesn't get better than this. Our second journey through this world, brought to life by the magic of Decima Engine, promises to be a far more satisfying experience in every aspect, finally realizing its true potential as an unforgettable adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Wojciech Gruszczyk](https://opencritic.com/critic/5528/wojciech-gruszczyk) - *Polish* - [9.5 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/373024/death-stranding-2-recenzja-gry-dla-najwiekszych-fanow-kuriera.html)\n\n&gt;In 2019, Hideo Kojima surprised the world with the story of the courier, only to continue his story a few years later. Death Stranding 2 is a game for Sam's fans who want to know his further fate. Give yourself to the story of the story, the characters and the world.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Bruno Henrique Vinhadel](https://opencritic.com/critic/3869/bruno-henrique-vinhadel) - *Portuguese* - [95 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Technically flawless and visually stunning, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an exceptional sequel and a clear evolution for a game that was already full of qualities. An even more engaging story with an improved narrative, as well as huge advances in its unique gameplay, are just some of the highlights of one of the best games of the year.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Álvaro Saluan da Cunha](https://opencritic.com/critic/10794/-lvaro-saluan-da-cunha) - *Portuguese* - [10 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;The feeling that remains is that we are faced with a work that marks not only this generation of consoles, but also a new chapter in Hideo Kojima's career and in the history of video games as a great means of artistic expression.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Joe Richards](https://opencritic.com/critic/10070/joe-richards) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-ps5-review/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is a triumph in what it sets out to achieve. This isn't a game interested in converting willing consumers into fans, it's a game that takes bold steps in order to succeed what came before it. If you needed proof that Hideo Kojima is still the titan of the industry that he's hailed as, this game is that proof. I was left truly speechless by the end, and I have a feeling that many others will too.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Liam Croft](https://opencritic.com/critic/1009/liam-croft) - [10 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach)\n\n&gt;In what will prove to be one of the defining games of the PS5 generation, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a profound achievement of design, gameplay, narrative, and visuals. As all four meet in the middle, Kojima Productions has crafted a cinematic spectacle that flawlessly transitions between action and traversal, all wrapped up in the most absorbing of narratives. An immense upgrade on the first game, Death Stranding 2 is an unequivocal masterpiece.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Quest Daily](https://opencritic.com/outlet/905/quest-daily)** - [Shaun Fullard](https://opencritic.com/critic/10685/shaun-fullard) - [9 / 10](https://questdaily.com.au/review/review-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-stranding-ps5/)\n\n&gt;DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH is a sequel through and through, not straying too far from the style and set-up established within the first game. Instead, choosing to improve upon the formula in almost every way, putting more focus on action, pacing, and enemy encounters.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Restart.run](https://opencritic.com/outlet/940/restart-run)** - [Jesse Vitelli](https://opencritic.com/critic/3256/jesse-vitelli) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.restart.run/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review?utm_source=OpenCritic&amp;utm_medium=backlink&amp;utm_campaign=Aggregators)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 is a game that pulls from the same playbook as the original, one that wants you to know it was made by the creator of Metal Gear Solid, and doesn't use its 55- hour runtime to pull on the threads that are interesting about the world. Instead, its focus on combat and retreading similar ground gets tiring fast. There are moments of something special here, but they can't shine past their own shadows.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Michal Korec](https://opencritic.com/critic/5204/michal-korec) - *Slovak* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40050/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach.htm)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 may not match the sales figures of its predecessor, nor recapture the magic of the original. However, it is a well-crafted sequel with expanded gameplay, new territories, a great plot, and lots of Metal Gear Solid elements waiting to be discovered after all these years.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SavePoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/960/savepoint-gaming)** - [Jake Su](https://opencritic.com/critic/6215/jake-su) - [9.5 / 10](https://savepointgaming.co/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-ps5-pro/)\n\n&gt;More of the same when it comes to a quality experience is never a bad thing, but Death Stranding 2 doesn't have the same wow factor that came with every little detail of the first. It is still an incredible, indie-esque realisation of a grand vision that only Kojima can come up with, and being exceptional instead of groundbreaking is still worth giving a thumbs up to.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;But even with its stumbles, Death Stranding 2 stuck with me. It’s messy. It’s over the top. It’s absolutely not for everyone. But it moved me. And for a game about carrying things, that feels like the point. It’s strange. It’s human. It’s heavy. Death Stranding 2 is worth the weight.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Cody Perez](https://opencritic.com/critic/3942/cody-perez) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-ps5-the-same-old-dance/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach continues the same gameplay from the original without any meaningful innovations or ideas. That said, the brilliant story and unparalleled music and performances make this worth a look.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Tuffcub](https://opencritic.com/critic/314/tuffcub) - [8 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can't help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Toisto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/953/toisto)** - [Joonatan Itkonen](https://opencritic.com/critic/11047/joonatan-itkonen) - [5 / 5 ](https://toisto.net/death-stranding-2-playstation5-review/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2 is the encapsulation of Hideo Kojima's ambition to marry films and games into one seamless experience. For the first time, it's not him emulating the cinema he adores. Instead, it's Kojima directing a vast, emotionally charged epic that others will imitate in years to come. It is a masterpiece of storytelling and game design. A peerless exploration of grief, found family, and all that we leave behind.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [5 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach delivers higher visual fidelity, consistent performance across the board, and a few new tricks that make gameplay more accessible, challenging, and fun. If you have the patience and come in with an open mind, you’ll be in an exclusive group of people who will struggle to describe this experience to anyone else.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Adam Ryan](https://opencritic.com/critic/5704/adam-ryan) - [10 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/)\n\n&gt;Immensely self-assured in the quality of its foundation, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach masterfully iterates and refines, while introducing considered additions that complement the experience, not complicate it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [9 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/6/23/reviews/146605-ps5-review-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/)\n\n&gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an improvement over Death Stranding in almost every way I can think of. It's larger, full of more things to do, and generally a more enjoyable experience. The plot is crazier than ever, which might be a plus or minus depending on your tastes, but if nothing else, it isn't boring. The only complaint I can think of is that the game is perhaps a touch too easy at times, and even that isn't a huge problem. If you liked the first game, it's very easy to imagine you liking the sequel. Just be prepared for things to be as unfathomably ridiculous as possible at every turn.\n\n-------------",

Maybe a little one, but plenty of hot women are in tv and movies. Instead of “reducing her career”, maybe we should be honest and say she is privileged to have a career in entertainment and perhaps she wouldn’t have one if it weren’t for her looks.\nThis is what bugs me about the “objectification” thing. Instead of woe-is-me, perhaps we should be talking about the leg up people get because of their looks.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly. No one would know who she is if it was not for the way that she looks. It is so disingenuous to try to make her looks this terrible thing that she is suffering from.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The lengths people will go to deny pretty privilege and female privilege is insane.

Why can’t both be true to you guys? Yes, she has gotten opportunities because of her body. Yes she has also been very upset over the harassment she has received over her body.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Imagine reading the Weinstein stories and walking away thinking “Wow, those women were so lucky, what a privilege to be given such a lucrative opportunity!”\nSick stuff dude, I’m actually flabbergasted at how gross you are\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Imagine completely making up bullshit that’s not even close to what someone said.\nThe mental gymnastics to go from “maybe some people have careers just because they look good” to “you support Harvey Weinstein” is absolutely insane.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;[You know, I’ve always suspected some people weapononize progressive language to mask deepseated jealousy and envy.\nJust because someone has big tits doesn’t justify their dehumanization.

Someone who is an actual slave is dehumanized. Someone with an acting career is not being dehumanized.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dehumanization is an action not a state of being. It’s something that someone does, not something that someone is. Because they’re objectively a human.\nDehumanization is taking away from someone the ability to be human or have human properties… for example, taking away someone’s ability to feel vulnerable and dehumanized just because they are in a position that you envy or desire. Charicaturization is an example of dehumanization.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When two completely different things are lumped under the same word and all actual qualifications, context, and differences are ignored or swept under the rug, it removes all ability to even discuss those things.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;[when i was in a celebrate recovery group (don't worry i recovered from Christianity) I met someone who said he was addicted to sending her nasty messages and jacking off to it. he had made multiple accounts on various websites to do it.\nbeing an attractive woman can be a curse. imagine waking up every day to people saying they wanted a piece of you by any means necessary? imagine getting into acting and everyone just wants you to take out your dick, and they don't give a shit at all they you've been trying to become an actor and launch a serious career? imagine seeing your parents and all they've seen of you on TV is you with your dick packed tight in your pants and they don't look at you the way they used to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1le9v0f/the_att_girl/myg4cfo/)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;What’s your point? Beauty enables societal advantages and also comes at the price of being ogled by weirdos.\nI’d argue the pros far outweigh the cons.\nSociety rewards attractive people disproportionately compared to average or ugly people. Nobody would bat an eye if she wad ugly but such is life.\nI mean fuck, the entire post from OP is about calling out her boobies. Double standards are unfair. In other news, water is wet.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Try to be empathetic for a minute- is grape not 1 of the things dudes are scared of experiencing if they go to jail?\nWomen don’t have to be in jail to experience that fear\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Rape. Not grape.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;[lol no? She’s literally leaning into it from her instagram selling “flirty” pictures for whatever random cause. Good for her for recognizing it but let's not pretend she's some victim for being attractive.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1le9v0f/the_att_girl/myg0k1h/)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The key difference is the control, and how little of it women ultimately have over the sexualization of their own bodies.\nOkay great, she can lean into it at times and use it to her advantage. But also, she can’t turn it off. There’s no safe place where she can just exist publicly without someone making a sexual comment or implication. That’s the part that gets exhausting and dehumanizing.\nI grew up with big tits, and it truly sucks to repeatedly experience men not taking anything else about you seriously solely due to a genetic trait you do not control. And that’s not even touching the disgusting things that were casually said to me on a regular basis.\nI wasn’t leaning into it when I was just a 13/14 year old kid, and yet I still couldn’t escape it. I can’t even imagine it on such a public scale. I feel like you could cut her some slack here.\nOr you can keep being hateful (bc I won’t think of you again beyond this moment anyway), but wanted to at least share the perspective you’re missing.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From a leverage standpoint in life though, would you say the objectification of your body was largely more positive or more negatively received vs being genetically ‘ugly’ and being seen as a ghost?\nHow many more relationships do you feel were enabled because of your body? How about in your career?\nSociety unfairly responds to beauty disproportionately compared to other attributes of personality.\nI could make the argument that men are measured by how much they’re materially worth which is objectively a harder mountain to climb. A man’s status is reflected based on his occupation, is that more unfair than if you’re born subjectively attractive?\nLife is cruel to both sides.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;[Hey dude, you're literally a misogynist. Have some fucking self reflection.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1le9v0f/the_att_girl/myg4yk5/) (This leads to a fun little slapfight)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;[Dude. Why are you so angry? Someone says they feel bad for someone who was distressed about the way they’re treated and you loudly declared “I DONT!” from the back of the room as if you were advocating for some noble cause. Dude you’re screaming “I’m an asshole, hear me roar” as loud as you can.\nWho the fuck hurt you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1le9v0f/the_att_girl/mygd2yx/)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;you're being willfully dense about what being pretty and having huge tits means for one's prospects in today's relatively safe civilization.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;[You’re so clearly a man that can’t have any way of comprehending what it’s like to be sexually objectified as a woman that your opinion has no merit whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangeAndFunny/comments/1le9v0f/the_att_girl/myfyord/)\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;She’s literally selling flirty pictures of herself from her instagram. Who's objectifying who?\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can say anyone harassing her is a piece of shit. While also realizing it’s ridiculous for her to act like she’s being objectified.\nI’ve seen pics of her at events, with damn near her whole chest showing. Basically just covering up her nipples. Which is totally fine, her choice.\nBut you can’t say “look at my boobs” while also saying “why are people looking at my boobs??” Not how it works. At least not how it works if you want empathy.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok, what’s your point?\nEven ignoring the fact that this isn’t some exhibitionist thing and that she’s literally raising money for charity, it might surprise you that a woman posting pictures of herself does NOT give anyone permission to sexually harass her.\nThe incel energy coming from you is off the charts.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, I don't know what's so hard to understand. As a straight man, I can, do, and will ogle women. I'm wired to do so - I wouldn't say I cannot help it, but I kind of cannot.\nBut that doesn't mean I then have to post odd, degrading, or harassing things about what I looked at.\nIt's sort of like when I go hiking and make it to a scenic spot. Just be silent and enjoy the view.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i’m sorry but why do you act like you’re just incapable of being a normal human and are hardwired to be a pervert\nmen are not like that, it’s disgusting and counter productive to keep lying that you’re hard wired to undress someone w ur eyes",

    "text": "The Complete Guide to AI Brand Visibility Tracking Tools and Strategies (Q2, 2025)\n***Nothing here is sponsored. Links are included for easy access while reading.*** ***This community will never feature sponsored content.***\n\nThe search landscape is experiencing its biggest shift since Google launched. With ChatGPT receiving 3 billion monthly visits, Perplexity growing 67% in traffic, and Google AI Overviews appearing on up to 84% of queries, traditional SEO metrics only tell half the story. Research shows 58% of consumers now use AI tools for product recommendations (up from 25% in 2023), and Gartner predicts 25% of search queries will shift to AI-driven interfaces by 2026.\n\nIf you're not tracking your brand's visibility across AI platforms, you're essentially flying blind in the fastest-growing segment of search. Here's everything you need to know about monitoring and improving your brand's presence in AI responses.\n\n# Current landscape of AI visibility tracking tools\n\nThe AI brand visibility tracking market exploded in 2024-2025, with over 25 specialized tools emerging and more than $50 million in venture funding flowing to the space. These aren't traditional SEO tools with AI features tacked on; they're purpose-built platforms designed to monitor how AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity reference your brand.\n\n# Enterprise-level platforms\n\n[**Profound**](https://www.tryprofound.com/) leads the enterprise market after raising $3.5 million from Khosla Ventures and South Park Commons. Founded by James Cadwallader and Dylan Babbs, Profound tracks brand visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Google AI Overviews. Their standout case study involves Ramp, which increased AI search visibility from 3.2% to 22.2% in one month, generating 300+ citations and moving from 19th to 8th place among fintech brands. The platform offers real-time conversation exploration, citation analysis, and what they call a \"god-view\" for agencies managing multiple clients.\n\n[**Evertune**](https://www.evertune.ai/) secured $4 million in seed funding with a founding team from The Trade Desk and AdBrain. Led by CEO Brian Stempeck, they focus on their \"AI Brand Index\" that measures LLM recommendation frequency across thousands of prompts for statistical significance. Their work with Porsche achieved a 19-point improvement in safety messaging visibility, narrowing the gap with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi in AI responses.\n\n# Mid-market solutions\n\n[**Peec AI**](https://peec.ai/), co-founded by Daniel Drabo, emphasizes statistical significance in AI tracking. Starting at €120 monthly, they cover ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews with competitive benchmarking and sentiment analysis. Their limitation is covering only 2 AI platforms per plan, but they compensate with detailed source analysis showing citation overlap between competitors.\n\n[**Otterly.AI**](https://otterly.ai) offers tiered pricing from $29 to $989 monthly, tracking Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity across 12 countries. While you must enter prompts manually one at a time, they provide solid link citation monitoring and country-specific insights.\n\n# Emerging and specialized tools\n\n**RankScale** represents the growing \"Generative Engine Optimization\" category. Founded by Austria-based Mathias Ptacek, it tracks seven AI platforms including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Google AI Overviews, and Mistral. Currently in beta with pay-as-you-go pricing starting at $20.\n\n**HubSpot AI Search Grader** provides free AI visibility analysis with sentiment tracking across GPT-4o and Perplexity, making it perfect for initial assessments.\n\nTraditional SEO platforms are also adding AI features. [**Semrush**](https://www.semrush.com/) now includes ChatGPT search engine targeting, [**Ahrefs**](https://ahrefs.com/) tracks AI Overviews visibility through Site Explorer, and [**SE Ranking**](https://seranking.com/ai-visibility-tracker.html) launched comprehensive AI visibility tracking across multiple platforms.\n\n# Essential metrics and signals for AI brand visibility\n\nUnderstanding what to track requires recognizing how AI systems differ from traditional search engines. While Google focuses on finding the \"best pages,\" AI platforms prioritize delivering the \"best answers\" to specific questions.\n\n# Core metrics that matter\n\n**Brand Mention Frequency** serves as your foundational metric, equivalent to impressions in traditional SEO. Track how often your brand appears in AI responses across different platforms, as performance varies significantly due to different data sources and algorithms.\n\n**Share of Voice (SOV)** measures the percentage of relevant AI answers mentioning your brand versus competitors. This metric proves crucial for competitive benchmarking and understanding market position in AI conversations.\n\n**Citation Rate** tracks how often your website receives actual links or citations in AI responses, not just mentions. Citations drive traffic and signal higher authority to AI systems.\n\n**Content Attribution** reveals which of your pages (homepage, product pages, blog posts) receive citations, showing which content AI systems trust most.\n\n# Understanding AI ranking factors\n\nResearch reveals that web mentions have the strongest correlation (0.664) with AI visibility, followed by brand search volume (0.392) and brand anchor text (0.527). Surprisingly, traditional backlink quality shows a weaker correlation (0.218) than expected.\n\nFor Google AI Overviews specifically, 52% of sources come from top 10 traditional search results, and the system heavily weighs E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) compliance. However, only 25% of #1-ranked content appears in AI search results, highlighting the need for AI-specific optimization.\n\nChatGPT and other LLMs consider six key factors: brand mentions across web platforms, positive reviews and testimonials, content relevancy to user queries, third-party recommendations, domain authority and social following, and brand establishment age.\n\n# What to focus your tracking efforts on\n\nBased on extensive analysis of successful AI visibility campaigns, prioritize these tracking areas:\n\n# Phase 1: Foundation building (0-3 months)\n\nStart with manual monitoring of 10-20 high-priority prompts across 2-3 major platforms. Focus on queries where customers typically discover brands in your category. Use free tools like [**HubSpot AI Search Grader**](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-seo) to establish baselines.\n\nTrack your current citation rate, sentiment analysis of brand mentions, and identify \"prompt gaps\" where competitors appear but you don't. This manual approach helps you understand the AI landscape before investing in comprehensive tracking tools.\n\n# Phase 2: Systematic tracking (3-6 months)\n\nImplement commercial tools for consistent measurement. Focus on visibility metrics (mention frequency, share of voice, citation rate), performance indicators (AI-driven traffic, conversion rates from AI referrals, query diversity), and competitive intelligence (competitor mention frequency, market share in AI conversations).\n\n# Phase 3: Advanced optimization (6+ months)\n\nFull integration with marketing analytics, ROI measurement, and strategic optimization based on accumulated data. At this stage, consider enterprise platforms that offer conversation exploration, real-time monitoring, and advanced competitive analysis.\n\n# Strategies for getting LLMs to find your brand in specific niches\n\nSuccess in AI visibility requires understanding that LLMs work through entity clusters. Your brand needs strong association with your niche topics through consistent messaging and authoritative content.\n\n# Entity association building\n\nCreate comprehensive topic clusters with interlinked articles that consistently use your target terminology. Develop proprietary research and unique data points that only your brand can provide. AI systems particularly value content they can cite with confidence.\n\nBuild community presence on platforms like Reddit, Stack Overflow (for technical brands), GitHub (for developer tools), and industry-specific forums. These platforms often serve as training data for AI models and provide valuable entity associations.\n\n# Content optimization for AI discovery\n\nStructure content with clear, hierarchical headings (H1-H6) and include direct answers at the beginning. Create FAQ sections using natural language questions that match how people query AI systems.\n\nUse semantic HTML elements, implement JSON-LD structured data, and maintain fast loading speeds. AI systems favor content that's easily parseable and technically sound.\n\nFocus on creating \"citation-worthy\" content: original surveys and studies, comprehensive guides covering all aspects of your specialty, expert interviews and thought leadership pieces, and industry reports that others naturally want to reference.\n\n# Platform-specific tactics\n\n**For Google AI Overviews**: Create concise summaries (50-70 words) at the top of content, optimize for featured snippets, and ensure comprehensive topic coverage addressing all user journey stages.\n\n**For ChatGPT**: Structure content with clear, fact-based statements using bullet points, numbered lists, and tables. Include brand-specific data and maintain consistent messaging across all web properties.\n\n**For Perplexity**: Focus on research-backed, academic-style content with unique images, charts, and diagrams. Create YouTube content as Perplexity references video content and shows higher conversion rates than other AI platforms.\n\n# Success measurement and implementation\n\nEffective AI visibility tracking requires both immediate actions and long-term strategy development.\n\n# Immediate implementation steps\n\nAudit current brand mentions across AI platforms using manual queries and free tools. Implement basic structured data (Organization, Product schemas) and ensure your robots.txt allows AI crawlers. Optimize your top-performing pages with AI-friendly formatting including clear headings, FAQ sections, and direct answers.\n\n# Long-term strategic development\n\nBuild comprehensive topic authority through content depth rather than breadth. Develop original research initiatives that position your brand as a data source. Establish thought leadership through consistent expert positioning and create systematic content optimization processes.\n\nTrack success through increased brand mentions in AI responses, higher quality traffic from AI referrals with longer sessions and better conversions, improved brand sentiment in AI-generated content, and growing market share in AI-driven searches within your industry.\n\n# Companies and people driving innovation\n\nThe AI visibility tracking space attracts experienced entrepreneurs with deep technical backgrounds. Beyond the founders already mentioned, notable figures include Crystal Carter (Google Developer Expert) who advocates for regular brand visibility testing across LLM platforms, Kevin Indig whose research revealed that LLMs focus less on backlink quantity and more on targeted, relevant content, and Glen Gabe who emphasizes brand consistency across all digital properties for improved AI recognition.\n\nThese industry leaders consistently emphasize that success requires maintaining traditional SEO excellence while adapting to AI-specific requirements around context, structure, and entity relationships.\n\n# Looking ahead\n\nThe convergence of traditional SEO and generative engine optimization represents a fundamental transformation in brand visibility. Early adopters gain significant competitive advantages, as seen in case studies where companies achieved 196% increases in organic revenue through AI-optimized content strategies.\n\nThe market shows strong momentum with continued funding, platform expansion beyond ChatGPT to comprehensive AI coverage, and increasing integration between traditional SEO tools and AI monitoring capabilities. Success comes from balancing proven authority-building strategies with emerging AI-specific optimization techniques.\n\nThis is just the beginning of understanding AI brand visibility.

    "text": "Pros and Cons of Buying Land for Sale in the US\nExisting Assets and Disadvantages of Acquiring Land for Sale in the United States\\\n\\\nPlunging into the realm of land ownership can be an exhilarating venture; nonetheless, it also encompasses a fair share of hazards and obstacles. Before immersing yourself in this domain, it is imperative to deliberate the benefits and drawbacks to ensure that you are making a well-informed choice. This piece will dissect the various facets of purchasing land for sale in the United States and converse about the potential merits and demerits linked with this investment.\\\n\\\nPositive Aspects of Obtaining Land for Sale in the United States\\\n\\\n1. Possibility for Appreciation: One of the chief benefits of acquiring land is its potential to appreciate over time. As opposed to structures, land is a limited resource, and its value can surge with increasing demand for real estate. This renders land a conceivably profitable long-term investment, as the property's value may persistently ascend.\\\n\\\n2. Versatility in Use: Land can serve a multitude of purposes, encompassing residential and commercial development, as well as agricultural or recreational pursuits. This versatility empowers landowners to determine the land's usage, granting them the chance to generate revenue or simply relish the space for personal purposes.\\\n\\\n3. Diversification of Portfolio: Investing in land can be a remarkable method to diversify your investment portfolio. Land is regarded as a tangible asset, which can furnish a safeguard against inflation and economic instability. By integrating land into your investment mix, you can spread out your risk and potentially amplify your comprehensive return on investment.\\\n\\\n4. Possibility for Tax Advantages: Ownership of land may furnish several tax benefits, such as deductions for property taxes, mortgage interest, and depreciation. Furthermore, if the land is utilized for farming or conservation objectives, there might be supplementary tax incentives accessible to the landowner.\\\n\\\n5. Authority Over Asset: Upon acquiring land, you assume full control over the property and the decisions concerning its utilization and advancement. This empowers you to effect changes and enhancements to the land according to your discretion, furnishing you with the opportunity to maximize its potential and augment its value.\\\n\\\nDrawbacks of Acquiring Land for Sale in the United States\\\n\\\n1. Upkeep and Maintenance Costs: Possessing land entails ongoing expenditures for maintenance and upkeep. These costs can encompass property taxes, landscaping, fencing, pest management, and more, contingent on the size and type of land. These expenditures can accumulate over time and should be incorporated into the comprehensive ownership expenses.\\\n\\\n2. Market Volatility: The value of land can fluctuate owing to evolving market conditions, economic elements, and local development trends. This unpredictability can make it challenging to foresee the future value of the land and may culminate in potential losses during market downturns.\\\n\\\n3. Zoning Restrictions and Regulations: Local zoning laws and land use regulations can substantially influence the development and utilization of the land. These constraints may circumscribe the types of edifices that can be erected, the activities that can be undertaken, and the comprehensive value of the property. It is imperative to meticulously scrutinize these regulations before procuring land to ascertain that it aligns with your intended utilization.\\\n\\\n4. Lack of Revenue Generation: Dissimilar to other categories of real estate investments, land generally does not yield revenue independently. While agricultural or commercial land may possess income potential, it frequently necessitates supplementary investment in development and management to realize a profit. This absence of immediate revenue can render land ownership a more protracted and speculative investment.\\\n\\\n5. Environmental and Liabilities Hazards: Landowners may encounter potential environmental hazards and liabilities, such as soil pollution, hazardous waste, or destruction caused by natural calamities. Mitigating these hazards can necessitate substantial time and monetary resources, and negligence to do so can precipitate legal and financial repercussions.\\\n\\\nFactors to Contemplate When Acquiring Land for Sale in the United States\\\n\\\nDuring the process of contemplating the acquisition of land, there are several pivotal factors to contemplate in order to arrive at an educated decision.\\\n\\\n1. Location and Accessibility: The location of the land plays a pivotal role in its value and potential usage. Elements such as proximity to urban hubs, access to utilities and infrastructure, and the general desirability of the region can profoundly influence the land's marketability and potential for appreciation.\\\n\\\n2. Land Size and Topography: The size and topography of the land can impact its potential for development as well as its comprehensive suitability for diverse purposes. Aspects such as soil quality, gradients, and natural resources must be meticulously assessed to gauge the land's capacity for development and its potential constraints.\\\n\\\n3. Zoning and Land Use Regulations: Comprehending the local zoning and land use regulations is imperative to ascertain that the land can be employed for its intended purpose. It is crucial to delve into the zoning classification, building limitations, and any environmental or conservation designations that may influence the property.\\\n\\\n4. Market Conditions and Trends: Delving into the local real estate market and development trends can yield valuable insights into the future potential of the land. Analyzing factors such as population growth, economic activity, and infrastructure development can aid in gauging the likelihood of land appreciation and demand in the region.\\\n\\\n5. Due Diligence and Environmental Assessments: Conducting comprehensive due diligence and environmental assessments is pivotal when procuring land. This can encompass soil testing, environmental site assessments, and legal title research to identify any prospective issues that may affect the property's value and usage.\\\n\\\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of land for sale in the United States can present an array of potential advantages, such as appreciation potential, portfolio diversification, and versatility in usage. Nonetheless, it also entails its quota of challenges, encompassing maintenance costs, market volatility, and regulatory constraints. Prior to committing to a land acquisition, it is crucial to deliberate the benefits and drawbacks, conduct thorough research, and seek professional counsel to make a well-considered investment decision.\\\n\\\nBy meticulously considering the factors outlined in this piece and carrying out the requisite due diligence, prospective land purchasers can formulate strategic and educated decisions that align with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. With the appropriate approach and cautious consideration, land ownership can be a gratifying and conceivably fruitful investment in the United States real estate market.\\\n\\\n\\\nAdditional Information: https://thelotstore.com/pros-and-cons-of-buying-land-for-sale-in-the-us/",

    "text": "3 Shoes from Qiaodan for $90: Wind 3 TR, PB4.0, Wind 3 Pro\n**Background:**\n\n* 30 year old Male\n\n* 170cm/c. 60kg, Size EUR 42.5/43\n\n* Mid/heel striker (closer to forefoot with faster speeds), wide-ish feet/some pronation issues, especially on my right foot.\n\n* PB of 20:10 for 5k and am training for my 1st half marathon, currently running 50-60km/week.\n\nOver the past month or two due to a combination of:\n\n* Impending replacement for my Novablast 4s (midsole getting flat/upper not ventilated enough for summer)\n\n* \"Needing\" a nimbler shoe for tempo/intervals/races (willfully ignoring my XTEP 260x)\n\n* Very compelling prices due to Chinese 618 sales.\n\n* Ended up with 3 shoes from Qiaodan for a total of c. 650 RMB (90 USD), only 1 of is earmarked for an actual need (replacing my NB4s) - so mission accomplished?\n\n**Wind 3 TR**\n\n* Total distance ran: 85km\n\n* Usage: Easy runs at roughly 5:00-5:50/km pace on brick, pavement and track, predominantly dry surfaces.\n\n**Specs**\n\n* 23mm forefoot/ 28mm rear 5mm drop (Shoe feels quite a bit taller than that though)\n\n* Weight: (EU 43) - 245g\n\n* Midsole - Kungfu pro HP (supercritical EVA?), small TPU shank for \"stability\" (spoilers: doesn't do anything)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Very cheap (157 RMB/22 USD due to sales, regularly at low-200s RMB)\n\n* Midsole foam feels cushioned but also plenty of rebound, good for mid-forefoot strikers.\n\n* Upper/heel strikes good balance between ventilated and comfortable/padded - good shoe for commutes.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Stability - see below\n\n* Shoelaces are not great - double knotting highly recommended for longer runs\n\n* Outsole rubber doesn't seem to have great durability nor good grip, starting to lose texture in the outer heel, does not feel grippy enough for speed sessions on track.\n\n* Some nice-to-haves are missing\n\n* Dumb bootleg Jordan logo for those who care about appearances.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis shoe was bought to replace my NB4s as a plateless daily trainer and in that role they are ...OK, *assuming a non-novice runner with good ankle strength*.\n\nIMO this shoe is trying to be mishmash of a speedwork shoe/daily trainer and ends up not being great at either. The biggest issue is stability - significant midsole cutout on the medial side combined with fairly soft foam means that this shoe will amplify any pronation tendencies. Mid/Heelstrikers especially will notice the medial side being lower which is pretty scary for those who already overpronate and give this shoe a high bar of entry far more akin to a tempo shoe than a daily trainer for novices.\n\nIt's a shame because the other parts of the shoes range from being passable to great (midsole foam especially so - a match for FFBlast+ in NB4), but the lack of stability really hurts this shoe's ability to be recommended.\n\n**PB 4.0**\n\n* Total distance ran: 45km\n\n* Usage: Tempo/Interval runs ranging from roughly 3:40-5:00/km on brick, pavement + track predominantly dry surfaces.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* 27mm forefoot/ 34mm rear 7mm drop\n\n* Weight: (US 8) - 190g\n\n* Midsole - Kungfu pro HP (supercritical EVA + TPU/PEBA blend?), carbon plate\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Cheap (270 RMB/38 USD due to sales, regularly at low-400s RMB)\n\n* Midsole foam is fairly cushioned while being energetic and propulsive - assuming decent pace.\n\n* Grippy outsole among the various surfaces tried, minimal wear (for now).\n\n* Upper is very ventilated while also comfortable, lacing feels cheap but locks in and doesn't untie over a long run.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Stability - more forgivable since this is a supershoe but still not friendly for overpronators and/or heel strikers.\n\n* Don't feel much propulsiveness from the carbon plate underfoot.\n\n* Very narrow midfoot - may cause pain to those with wide feet/flat arches where the foot would be contacting the upper instead of the insole.\n\n* Annoying tongue that is secured to the upper on one side only, takes time when lacing up to ensure that it doesn't scrunch up.\n\n* Dumb bootleg Jordan logo for those who care about appearances\n\n**Notes:**\n\nNeeds a run or two to activate the midsole whereupon it becomes a nice mix of compliance and bounciness, the midsole is named Kungfu Pro HP same as Wind 3 TR but clearly trades some compliance for energy rebound - not that it lacks in the former. For mid/forefoot strikers this shoe makes it easy to reach and keep fast paces for a given effort level.\n\nMidfoot is narrow ala old Nike Vaporfly/Alphafly so wide feet beware - walking around/slow paces means my feet are in contact with the upper sidewalls and not the midsole, this can cause some pain but goes away at faster paces.\n\nNot friendly to heel strikers - there's a decent chunk of heel to cushion the initial impact but the transition from there to the midfoot is not great. The tapered midfoot design means the space underneath foot arches feels like there's no foam support underneath, which is again, troublesome for overpronators.\n\n**Wind 3 Pro**\n\n* Total distance ran: 38km\n\n* Usage: Tempo + interval runs ranging from 3:40-5:30/km on brick, pavement + track, both dry and wet surfaces.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* 24mm forefoot/ 32mm rear 8mm drop\n\n* Weight: (EU 43) - 230g\n\n* Midsole - Kungfu turbo HP (PEBA), carbon plate\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Cheap (230 RMB/32 USD due to sales, regularly at low-300s RMB)\"\n\n* Midsole foam is energetic and bouncy - assuming good cadence/pace.\n\n* Grippy outsole among the various surfaces and weather conditions tested\n\n* Stable - friendly to (modest) overpronators at a variety of paces\n\n* Overall best upper of the bunch, ventilated while being sufficiently padded with less niggles than the other 2 shoes, lacing feels cheap but locks in and doesn't untie over a long run\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Underfoot feel is firm - not for runners who want more cushion feel, may not have enough cushion for a full marathon distance.\n\n* Requires higher cadence to get the most out of the foam\n\n* Narrow midfoot - better than the PB4 but may cause pain to those with wide feet/flat arches where the foot would be contacting the upper instead of the insole.\n\n* Dumb bootleg Jordan logo for those who care about appearances\n\n**Notes:**\n\nOut of the 3 shoes, this was the shoe that arguably reviewed least well. First impressions were not great as the foam was rock hard and felt wooden. Gets significantly better after a break-in but still asks of the runner (c. 5:00/min pace or below with fast turnover) to make the most out of it, rebound is fast, a great match for tempo/interval work but not for easier paces.\n\nHaving said that this shoe is the most novice-friendly as it is the most stable shoe (clearly) of the 3, the firm midsole resists pronation at a variety of paces and footstrike patterns. For my tastes this is surprisingly the best shoe out of the 3 as it is the shoe where I have the least concern of aggravating my ankle when striking/pushing off.\n\nOn a sidenote - Wind 3 Pro feels like v2 of the XTEP 260x v1.0 with improvements in multiple facets - bouncier foam, slightly more stable, better upper/lacing etc, fans of that shoe should look at this as a true successor.\n\nTLDR;\n\n\\- Wind 3 Pro is a great tempo trainer/racer hybrid for those who like fast turnover and firm feel underfoot, easiest recommendation of the three for a \"fast\" shoe without the compromises of a full race-day shoe.\n\n\\- PB4.0 is a good racer for mid/forefoot strikers with no pronation issues, assuming those conditions are met this is a supershoe that can work at surprisingly modest paces.\n\n\\- Wind 3 TR is an awkward compromise between a daily trainer and a speedwork shoe but doesn't do either well, the best thing it has for it is that it's cheap - but most people would benefit looking elsewhere for a daily trainer.",

    "text": "Leggings Lift Butt: White Scrunch Leggings Review!\n**Leggings That Actually Lift Your Butt?! (Honest Review) - White Scrunch Leggings**\n\n\nOkay, Reddit, I need to spill the tea on these leggings.  I'm usually a jeans-and-a-tshirt kind of gal, but lately, I've been trying to get more into athleisure.  The problem?  Most leggings just…aren't flattering.  They either sag in all the wrong places, or they're so tight they're uncomfortable.  I've tried a ton of different brands, from cheap ones to pricey ones, and I was starting to lose hope.\n\nThen, I stumbled across these white scrunch leggings.  I know, white leggings?  Risky, right?  But I was desperate.  And let me tell you, these are NOT your average white leggings.  The scrunch design is what really sets them apart.  It's strategically placed – not just a random scrunch anywhere – and it seriously lifts and shapes your butt.  I'm talking a noticeable difference.  I even took before-and-after photos, and wow.  It's like having a little built-in lift.\n\nNow, I'm not one for shapewear, those things are suffocating!  These leggings provide the same effect without the discomfort. I can wear these all day, doing errands, going to the gym, even just lounging around the house.  They're surprisingly comfortable.  The fabric is a really nice blend – feels stretchy and durable, not thin and cheap.  I’ve worn them multiple times, and they haven't pilled or stretched out at all.\n\nWhat surprised me the most is how versatile they are.  These aren't just for workouts. They’re great for casual wear! I've dressed them up a bit with a flowy blouse and sandals for a date night. They're perfect for grocery shopping,  running errands, or even grabbing a quick coffee with friends.  They’re honestly the perfect combination of comfort and style. They instantly make me feel more confident, and that's worth more than a fancy dinner out, for real.\n\nAnother big plus?  They're not crazy expensive. I found them on ursupermart.com.  Sure, they're not the cheapest leggings on the market, but for the quality, the fit, and the actual butt-lifting magic they perform, they’re totally worth the price. The cost of shapewear alone over the years would have probably paid for several pairs of these.  And trust me, you won't regret splurging.\n\nSo, if you're tired of leggings that make you feel frumpy or insecure, do yourself a favor and check these out.  They really are game-changers.  I'm actually considering ordering another pair in black, and maybe even trying out one of the other colors they offer.  I know what I’m doing with my next payday, LOL.  These high-waisted scrunch leggings are perfect for small butts, like mine, providing amazing support, and lifting the booty. I felt instantly more confident and comfortable.  Seriously, these things are a lifesaver for days when you want to feel good about yourself, in a casual and comfortable outfit.\n\nHere's the link if you’re curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/9WTtpq\n\nSeriously, I can't recommend these white scrunch leggings enough.  They're comfortable, flattering, and make me feel fantastic.  They're the perfect addition to any wardrobe. And hey, you can thank me later. 😉  Check them out!  https://go.ursupermart.com/9WTtpq",

    "text": "The Pros and Cons of Hiring a Professional Land Search Team\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of Employing a Qualified Land Exploration Team\\\n\\\nIn the current fast-moving world, land development and property investment are gaining popularity. Whether you are an individual looking to acquire a piece of land for your ideal home or a developer in search of the perfect site for a commercial project, locating the right land can be an overwhelming task. This is where specialized land exploration teams play a crucial role. These teams specialize in discovering possible land parcels for purchase and they can be a valuable resource for anyone seeking land. Nonetheless, similar to any service, there are both upsides and downsides to engaging a qualified land exploration team. In this article, we will examine the benefits and drawbacks of seeking the assistance of these professionals so that you can make an informed decision when it comes to your land exploration.\\\n\\\nPros of Employing a Qualified Land Exploration Team\\\n\\\n1. Proficiency and Know-how: One of the primary benefits of hiring a qualified land exploration team is their proficiency and experience in the industry. These professionals possess a profound understanding of the local market and zoning prerequisites, and they comprehend what to seek in a potential land parcel. They can economize your time and effort by rapidly pinpointing suitable properties that meet your criteria.\\\n\\\n2. Access to Exclusive Listings: Qualified land exploration teams frequently have access to exclusive listings that are not accessible to the general public. This can provide you with an advantage in a competitive market, as you may be able to uncover properties that others are oblivious to. This can be particularly advantageous if you are searching for a specific kind of land or a site with limited availability.\\\n\\\n3. Negotiation Proficiency: Qualified land exploration teams are adept negotiators, and they can aid you in securing a fair price for the land you wish to purchase. They possess the knowledge and experience to navigate the negotiation process and ensure that you are obtaining the best deal feasible.\\\n\\\n4. Local Insight: A qualified land exploration team will possess an exhaustive understanding of the local vicinity, encompassing the current market trends, neighborhood demographics, and forthcoming development plans. This can be invaluable when making a decision about where to invest in land, as they can offer insight into potential opportunities and risks.\\\n\\\n5. Time Conservation: Scouting for land can be a time-consuming and exhausting process. By engaging a qualified land exploration team, you can assign this responsibility and concentrate on other facets of your project, such as financing and design. This can save you a substantial amount of time and stress.\\\n\\\nCons of Employing a Qualified Land Exploration Team\\\n\\\n1. Expenses: Engaging a qualified land exploration team can be costly, particularly when seeking a substantial parcel or having particular requirements. Their charges are typically based on a percentage of the purchase price, so the cost can accumulate swiftly. This may not be feasible for everyone, particularly if you are operating with a restricted budget.\\\n\\\n2. Limited Authority: When you enlist a qualified land exploration team, you are essentially confiding in their assessment and expertise. While this can be advantageous in numerous cases, it also implies that you have restricted authority over the exploration process. If you possess a specific vision or set of requirements for your land, you may find it exasperating to rely on someone else to discover the ideal property for you.\\\n\\\n3. Potential Conflicts of Interest: Some qualified land exploration teams may have connections with specific sellers or developers, which could engender a conflict of interest. They may be more predisposed to prioritize these connections over your best interests, which could result in a prejudiced recommendation or a missed opportunity.\\\n\\\n4. Insufficient Personalization: Qualified land exploration teams collaborate with multiple clients concurrently, signifying that they may not be capable of delivering the level of personalization and attention to detail that you would acquire from conducting the exploration yourself. They may also have a standardized approach to discovering land, which may not align with your precise needs and preferences.\\\n\\\n5. Excessive Reliance on the Team: When you engage a qualified land exploration team, you may become extraordinarily reliant on them for the triumph of your land exploration. This can foster a sense of complacency and diminish your own drive to actively engage in the exploration process. This can be risky, as you may overlook opportunities that you could have identified independently.\\\n\\\nIn conclusion, engaging a qualified land exploration team has both advantages and disadvantages. While they can deliver valuable expertise, access to exclusive listings, and conserve your time, they also come with a cost, limited authority, and potential conflicts of interest. Before determining whether to seek the assistance of a qualified land exploration team, it is imperative to thoroughly contemplate your budget, goals, and preferences to ascertain whether their services correspond with your needs. Ultimately, the decision to engage a qualified land exploration team should be grounded on a comprehensive evaluation of these factors and a clear understanding of the potential benefits and drawbacks.\\\n\\\n\\\nAdditional Information: https://thelotstore.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-hiring-a-professional-land-search-team/",

    "text": "Amazfit Balance 2 First Impression\nJust brought Amazfit Balance 2 (B2) yesterday in China to replace its former model Amazfit Balance (B1).\n\nSet up all the things and played with it for a while, and here's the first impression.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fecxn5ct412f1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaee02070104b765b762c1a573e7d06c93d83d26\n\n# Pros\n\n* Design\n   * The overall design is further polished. The crown and button is much more solid, and the texture touches good. The body color and texture is more business and premium. The blue ring around the face makes it more like a traditional watch. It's 7g heavier but actually make B2 less \"cheap\". B1 has a great design and I really love it, while it's a bit like a \"gadget\" compared with B2.\n* Display\n   * Surprisingly, althouth the same PPI, B2's display looks a bit clear. The edge of fonts is now a bit less blurry. I guess the pixel layout may be improved but I hasn't checked it. The difference is not big and can be ignored without comparason, but still a good thing. However, not sure if it's only mine, in the lowest brightness, the color on B2 is not as pure as B1, like those early day OLED displays. Also, seems there's no oil-proof layer on B2, so it's easier to get finger prints on the surface.\n* Speaker\n   * To be honest I never use the speaker on B1. However, I have a quick check to the stereo speaker on B2, and the sound quality is greatly enhanced. It's impressive as of a smartwatch, while I don't think it a valid selling point that adds weight and cost to it.\n* Response\n   * Faster than B1. There's a lag when opening the app menu, and the lag is much smaller on B2. The first time of the period you open the menu, it loads faster. Then it loads super fast. Also, Sleep record in the wedget list loads faster.\n* Viberation\n   * The linear motor is enhanced, and the viberation is now not so cheap.\n* Battery\n   * As the battery volume increases a lot, it's expected to be 50% long battery life. Personally, I enable all the health monitoring features, no phone call and notification, run &gt;20km per week and AOD on. The battery lasts \\~7 days with B1, and I expect to have \\~10 days with B2.\n* GPS\n   * I'm very satisfied with the GPS of B1, and had a 1km walk in the city today, and I can say B2 is just as good as B1. Fast satilite searching, and quite accurate location as usual.\n* Heart rate\n   * To be tested later. Previously, GTR4 sometimes had very high/low heart rate, especially in raining days or low temperature days. B1 improved and generally reliable, but the issue still occurred occasionally. I'm fine with what B1 has, but I hope B2 will further improve. I need a couple of days to verify whether there's obserable improvement.\n\n# Cons\n\n* Watch face - Issue Resolved!\n   * I'm so excited to find that, today, in the device page of the Zepp app, in the watch faces recommendation section, my favorite watch face, Vast Sky, the default one from B1, is listed. This is now also searchable, and actually listed in the official watch faces category. I synced it to my B2 and everything is working perfectly now. I'm not sure why this happened. Has someone read this post and uploaded the non-eye-protection version? Anyway, it's a big surprise and got rid of the disappointment in the past two days when I noticed this issue. However, although I'm so happy to find it fixed (and will be more willing to recommend Amazfit to my friends), I decided to leave this one in the cons, as it should not happen from the very beginning. Keep improving!\n   * The built-in watch faces are not as good as those in B1. I super love the default face, Vast Sky, on B1. There's a so called eye-protection version of Vast Sky available in the watch face store, but it's buggy. It will turn to night model randomly, even flashing. Tried reinstallation but no good. Also, the preview of this watch face in Zepp app's device page also flashes between normal and night mode, which is annoying. This is actually a big disappointment that even make me hesitate to switch from B1 to B2. If you do like B1's default watch face, think twice. I'm now using another face downloaded from the store, but this cannot make me 100% happy.\n* Zepp OS 5\n   * It's 99% the same to Zepp OS 4 and I don't think it should be branded as a newer version. It adds a useless magnifying glass mode, a maybe useful gloove mode, showing interesting points in the map, and a slightly different UI layout/style in sports tracking mode.\n   * Also, now Flac files are supported to be transferred to the device, which saves my effort to convert my music files to mp3 format. However, currently the Flac format is not supported to be played on B2. It took me long to transfer the big files, then when I clicked to play, it just says not supported now.\n   * Apps not easy to use:\n      * Weather data not accurate\n      * Calendar cannot set start day of a week\n      * Meditation app no i18n for years\n      * In the Zepp app, functions like music management, training template, etc... are just not easy to use. Zepp does provide lots of features which, well, works to some extent. But many of them are far from good, and I didn't see Zepp improved them in the past years. So in 2025, sometimes I feel like tweeking a fancy digital toy when configuring my Amazfit smart device (while reminds me of my young days lol)\n   * Zepp Flow is missing. It's available on my B1, so there could be some feature flags behind that hide it on my B2. I seldon use it and hope it won't miss in other regions.\n* Feature limitation by account region\n   * My account region is non-China, so the very required features in China such as NFC transpotation cars, NFC lock keys, WeChat/AliPay Payment, are all disabled. There's no way to change the region of an account except for creating a new one. However, if I create a new account in China region, I will lose the 3rd party data sync to Google Fit and Strava. This is really weird. On GTR4, the hardware sold in China is bind to China, so even if the account is non-China, all those China-limited features are still available, and it's super convenient. However, starting from B1, the device is global and configured to be region specific by the Zepp account. There're lot of people in China using Strava, and almost none of them consider Amazfit. They're usually heavy users who runs/ cycles a lot, and willing to pay for premium smartwatches. They're mostly using Garmin now as Garmin don't limit features by account region in such a broken way. Say, one brought his Amazfit watch outside of China and accordingly created a non-China account, then he loses the access to all the China-limited features in his life. If he's going to live in China, it's highly likely he will change to another brand. (Why I don't change? Because I find Amazfit's design better than Garmin, otherwise I will just change. And now on B2, my favorite watch face broke) BTW, Zepp started to invest more in Japanese market, however, the Japanese translation in Zepp app is very poor and inconsistent. Do not use the tranditional translation tools for i18n. Use any of the moderm LLM and you will get better results.\n\n# More about running\n\nWell, the new metrics of vertical oscillation and ground contact time are one of the point I'm interested. They've already been available on other brands for long, and they're useful reference for improving the result.\n\nI had a 5km workout in the morning, and below is the result.\n\n* Weather data - I don't reveal the track/map here, but surprisingly now there's weather/ wind data displayed at the bottom of the map. The Zepp app has no update this week, so it should be a flag to show weather data for specific device.\n* GPS - generally good as B1, from the shape of the track. And my personal feeling, the heart rate is reasonable.\n* Ground contact time - it's 227 on average, which is very close to 235 from another device, Casio's [Motion Sensor](https://runmetrix.casio.com/jp/index.html), a small device that attached on my back. However, there's a very low value, 106, at the start of the workout, when I'm warming up. So there should be room to improve the algorithm to filter out outstanding values.\n* Vertical oscillation - it's much higher than the motion sensor. I assume B2, as a watch, will be harder to get accurate vertical oscillation data, than those attached at middle of the body. Need to have more data to say more.\n* BUG - the device name synced to Strava is still Amazfit Balance, but not Balance 2. In previous models, the incorrect device name in Strava bug also happened.\n\nSo far, I don't find any great change/improvement on B2 for running. As B1, it should be good enough for running from daily workout to full marathon race. The GPS and heart rate are just accurate and reliable. And now I'm confident that the +7g weight won't impact my performance :)\n\nBesides, I hope there could be more realtime chart available on the watch, such as performance, power, ground contact time, etc. Also, in the Zepp app, I need more charts to view the trends of specific running metrics. Now they can be only viewed by single workout, and I have no way to learn if the metrics are getting better or not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ntovz8j582f1.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f5bee98f97061bad8ff2317bbd393baf542d5a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/093es07j582f1.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd0c1ec0591bbb79f19f7cc2cdbd213d4ca3fd7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y91q617j582f1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9349f2c351e4c8457e49f1cdc192060ee2b8ccc0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3lrxpy8j582f1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab1e3fee9c82acde694f648606fedde65a17a84\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI believe the hardware team of Amazfit is doing a really great job. Kudos!\n\nOn the other hand, the software team just don't meet the expectation. Amazfit started its global business very early and should have the sense how to design software, including the account system, to meet the requirements for global users. Software should have been a strength for a Chinese company, and I hope Amazfit can do better before I finally decided to switch to another brand in some day in the future.\n\nP.S. Now the watch face Vast Sky is working on B2 :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbyld1gcia2f1.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbf5c92eb78a0ef01fc32eefbcd4358dfd74a1b8\n\n**Update Jun 25, 2025**\n\nA new app added on B2 to support heart rate push from the new Helio Strap.\n\nAn announcement from Amazfit Japan official says that due to the software development delay, BioCharge is planned to be rolled out on B2 around 2nd half July \\~ August.

    "text": "Should a Discord bot live inside your Django project or run as a separate service? Pros, cons, and best practices?\nI made a website for Monster Hunter Fashion sets (as a searchable db for cool looking sets instead of them being in a ton of discords and subreddits).\n\nI also made a Discord server so that the users can interact without me having to make a messaging system or comment sections and make the moderation easier. I have a trained ml classifier for the images and nsfw. In the discord I moderate the comments.\n\nWith that as a background, I have the following question:\n\nShould I make the discord bot as a django app or as an independent thing?\n\nThe benefit of it being a django app is that it can access the orm directly and I don’t need to build an api. The commands would be views and that is very simple to handle and maintain, since I wouldn’t have to worry about the interaction of the independent bot and the django project (which I assume would be handled in the views either way but in a more complex fashion).\n\nThe benefit of it being its own thing is that its more flexible and independent, I guess. I’ve never done a bot like this before, so I have no idea if there are things I haven’t considered.\n\nThe bot will have many functions, but the one that makes me wonder if making it as an app is easier is that it should have access to the orm so that users are able to use the bot to reference sets from the website directly in discord. That way I can have a seamless experience between both sites. I think that calling the orm directly is easier than making a whole api and separate thing just for this.\n\nMy project is a monolith btw. I am using Django + HTMX + Bootstrap only. No fancy DRF or anything like that. Making a bot as the only external service feels weird but maybe I’m just inexperienced.\n\nAny suggestions would be awesome, thanks for reading!\n\nHere is the website in question:\nhttps://www.hunterfashioncommission.com",

    "text": "My humiliating bridesmaid dress shopping experience.\nI was a bridesmaid in the wedding of my childhood friends last year. Bride was super chill, rule was \"Whatever you want, just make it navy.\" I live in NYC, no shortage of bridal shops, so I made an appointment at one near my apartment.\n\nThe lady didn't measure me or even ask my size. She looked me up and down and said, \"You're what, a size 14?\" I used to be overweight (I'm a healthy weight now), and I wore a size 14 at my HEAVIEST— 50lbs more than I weigh now. So I corrected her and said, \"No, I'm an 8 to 10. We can start with 10.\" She scrunched her face up and said, \"No, I don't think so.\" Fine, she knows best, dress sizing can be weird, I try not to get hung up on the number and let her pull a bunch of 14s.\n\nAll the dresses she pulled for me were way too big. Like falling off me. And when I said they seemed too big, she argued with me that they weren't. Eventually she got frustrated with me and told me I can just pull and try on whatever I want. I grab a size 10 and ask if I can try it, and she said, \"I mean, you can try it, but it probably won't fit.\" I could feel the tears coming in my throat so I cut the appointment short and said I had to get back to work. I cried the entire way home.\n\nShe completely destroyed my confidence. I cried for DAYS. I kept asking my partner if I had gained weight, if I was just blind to it, I wouldn't look myself in the mirror, I felt like I couldn't trust my own eyes or the tape measures or the scale. Eventually I ordered some dresses from a bridal chain online, all in size 12. And guess what? They were ALL too big. \n\nI ended up wearing a size 8 to the wedding. You know, the size I said I was. My friends theorized that she was intentionally trying to sell me a dress that was too big so I'd have to pay them for alterations.",

Never medicated for it until starting at straterra 3 months ago.  For which, I’ve worked my way up to 80mg. \n\nLong time sufferer of anxiety and depression, and generally speaking, an extremely over active mind.  \n\nI felt the effects of 25mg on the first day I took it.  It felt like a blunted stimulant.  For the first few weeks, and as I worked my way up in dosage, I was convinced this was my miracle cure.  I felt amazing.  The effect that this medication has had on my anxiety has been nothing short of profound.  My otherwise over active mind has been quieted.  My day to day, minute to minute peace of mind has been, and remains fantastic.  \n\nHowever, any positive emotions that I would otherwise be feeling have also been greatly diminished.  My favorite music resonates in a different, more muted way.  Watching a sunset over my property after cutting the grass, which would otherwise have felt euphoric and fulfilling, feels just sort of meh.  Not bad, but far from the great that I’m familiar with.  \n\nI understand that this is a common and expected side effect given strattera’s impact on the dopamine reward system, and I plan to work with my therapist to lower my dosage in order to find a better sweet spot.  However, if this “emotional blunting” side effect is to remain at any dosage that is effective for continuing to lower my anxiety and quiet my mind, I have a trade off proposition to be weighed.  I should also mention the other side effect of greatly diminished libido.  It was never high to begin with, but it’s now essentially zero.  Obviously, far from ideal.\n\nSo there you have it.  Is the juice worth the squeeze?  I truly can’t decide.",

    "text": "“Profoundly mediocre”: Brittany finally receives and reviews As ever order\nBrittany picks up with her As ever review, after threatening to leave a bad review on Better Business Bureau. If you missed the beginning of the debacle, she paid $20 for expedited shipping to get it before her trip. They sent the wrong tracking number and it took 8 days and missed her departure so it sat in the rain. She is back from her trip and reviews all products except for the honey and flower sprinkles, which were sold out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jwsUuU8Qogc\n\n*Brittany gave everything a “fair shake and some stuff is not too bad” but other items are “not great.”\n\n*You’re paying a premium price because That One “is a duchess, no other reason.” The products are “profoundly mediocre” and the packaging is “profoundly cheap.” \n\n*The packaging looks like it was put together at the last minute. The “keepsake thing is completely worthless.” The box is “too shallow” to store love notes, as That One suggests.\n\n*The tea packaging tin was “very cheap” and the label was put on crooked with bubbles underneath, which is weird “for someone obsessed with packaging.”\n\n*Brittany seeps the teas during the recording and compares them live to Highgrove teas. The Highgrove tea packaging was more high quality as the label is printed directly on the tin.\n\n*The AE spread jar (7.6 oz) is “microscopic” compared to the Highgrove spread jar (12 oz). The nice grocery store brand Bonne Mamar is even 13 oz.\n\n*The AE product line is too “mid” to charge a premium for it.\n\n*Brittany is offended at the card included in That One’s fauxligraphy which says “Enjoy.” She takes the card and flicks it across the room. \n\n*Brittany is still very mad they emailed her to say the package is on the way but didn’t give her the correct tracking number so she could track it while traveling. It “sat out in the rain all night.” It’s That One’s fault because her name is “all over” the product.\n\n*The unboxing - it is wrapped in tissue with an AE sticker. The tissue was wrinkled from getting rained on. There is an “open with care” sticker in That One’s fauxligraphy. \n\n*Brittany pulls out the shortbread mix, crepe mix and shows the ingredients and nutrition facts “for all those people wondering;” Peppermint, hibiscus and lemon ginger tea which are “itty bitty” packages; and the spread in the alleged keepsake box.\n\n*Peppermint tea- Highgrove’s tea bag is smaller and has a subtle scent. AE’s is bigger but smells “nasty” and “like toothpaste.” The AE tea tag is blank and has no branding which is “cheap.” She lets it steep and tastes them. Highgrove is “subtle” and “infusing into her mouth.” She sips AE and makes a hideous gagging face. AE “bombards you with peppermint” like “toothpaste.” Highgrove has 15 bags for less cost than AE’s 12. She is still gagging and needs to take a break.\n\n*Lemon Ginger tea- it’s “not bad” but “not exciting” and leaves an “industrial,” “weird taste in the mouth.” It seems “poorly manufactured.” There seems a smaller amount in the bag than the peppermint and the tag is also blank. You “can get the same thing for half the price or less.”\n\n*Hibiscus tea- this one is “not bad” and her “favorite.” But she “wouldn’t go out of her way” to buy it and can get the same thing elsewhere “for half the price.” She starts reading the description on the label and finds a “spacing issue” between some of the words. She again makes fun of That One “obsessing over packaging” and doing “that fake thing looking at the packaging.”\n\n*She goes back to the other tea boxes and says all of the labels are put on crooked with bubbles and a “cheap sticker”. It doesn’t say where the tea is made, just that it is from “As Ever Enterprises”.\n\n*The peppermint tea description says it’s “the favored tea in [The Todger] home” which Brittany says makes her “question their taste buds immensely,” and the tea is “not soothing at all”.\n\n*Shortbread cookie mix- Brittany made the mix earlier because it is “complicated” because you need an electric mixer. It “took a while” to make. She shows earlier when she made the mix. She reads the box and pulls everything out and criticizes the tiny amount of flower sprinkles and the crooked seal. She is “severely” underwhelmed. It’s not “elevated” and there is better shortbread elsewhere for $14. The brand “does not have longevity.” The dough then had to be chilled for an hour. It was “too complicated” to make. She tastes them live and they were “actually pretty good” but she wouldn’t buy them again. Brittany’s mom said it was just a sugar cookie and nothing exciting about it.\n\n*Brittany didn’t put in the tiny pack of flower sprinkles into the cookie mix because she wants to keep them and compare them to other brands of flower sprinkles. Again criticizes the crooked seal because it’s $14 and “didn’t meet” that high standard. She eats some of the flowers and makes another sickly gagging face calling it “gross.” She says Chrystal’s Scottish shortbread from the airport is “fantastic.”\n\n*Crepes- Brittany makes them in her kitchen. She made them once and “wasn’t impressed” and made them a second time. It was “just ok, it’s mediocre slop she’s charging a premium for because she’s a duchess… it’s not a premium product.” She tries crepes with the spread, makes an icky face and says “not great… kind of bad.” She ate one whole crepe and “threw away the rest of the dough.”\n\n*Brittany reads the cookie box and laughs at That One calling the cookies “a hug in a box.” Brittany says they’re “literally sugar cookies” and “not that impressive.”\n\n*The crepe box says they bring That One “immense joy.” Brittany said she did not feel that from the crepes. It’s “just average” and “not exciting.” There’s another typesetting issue with “uneven” spacing and “didn’t go through quality control.”\n\n*The spread- She makes a weird face and calls it “a little tart”, “sort of artificial” and “ok” but “not good.” She would “never grab it again.” She compares it against Fortnum and Mason. Her dad loved F&amp;M which is organic with chunks of real fruit.\n\n*She takes the AE spread and drips it into the jar making a gross face and calling it “not that appealing”. She eats a spoonful and says “whoever said they can eat this out of the jar is lying.”\n\n*The only thing she liked is the hibiscus tea and shortbread but there are better versions for a better price. AE is not perfect or elevated. It’s “mediocre in every single fashion”. The range goes from “abysmal to mediocre.” \n\n*That One should be using Instagram to demo her products. She doesn’t appear to feed these products to her own alleged children.\n\n*The cookies are “cumbersome,” not fun to make and not worth the effort for $14. The brand is “going to collapse” at some point.",

    "text": "Are Indoor Hydroponic Gardens Worth It? Pros, Cons, And Real Results\nEvaluating the Benefits and Challenges of Indoor Hydroponic Gardens\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIndoor hydroponic gardens offer an exciting opportunity for urban dwellers and gardening enthusiasts alike. As you explore this method of growing plants without soil, it is important to assess both the benefits and challenges associated with this gardening technique. Understanding these aspects will help you decide if diving into an indoor hydroponic system is worth it for your lifestyle and space.\n\n### Benefits of Indoor Hydroponic Gardens\n\nOne of the most appealing features of indoor hydroponic gardens is their potential to produce fresh, nutritious food year-round. By eliminating the need for soil, hydroponics also allows you to control various environmental factors, leading to several distinct advantages:\n\n- **Space Efficiency:** Hydroponic systems can be set up in small areas, making them ideal for apartments or homes with limited outdoor space.\n- **Faster Growth:** Plants grown in hydroponic systems often grow faster than those in soil due to better access to nutrients and optimized growing conditions.\n- **Water Conservation:** Hydroponics uses significantly less water than traditional gardening methods, allowing you to conserve this precious resource.\n- **Less Weeding:** With no soil structure, you face fewer weed issues, giving you more time to enjoy your plants without the hassle of constant maintenance.\n- **Pest Management:** Indoor gardens are less prone to certain pests, which can simplify pest control strategies and reduce the need for pesticides.\n\n### Challenges of Indoor Hydroponic Gardens\n\nDespite their many benefits, indoor hydroponic gardens also come with a few challenges that you should consider before making a commitment:\n\n- **Initial Investment:** Setting up a hydroponic system can require a significant upfront investment in equipment, such as grow lights, pumps, and nutrient solutions.\n- **Technical Knowledge Required:** Successful hydroponic gardening involves understanding various concepts like pH levels, nutrient concentrations, and light requirements, which may be overwhelming for beginners.\n- **System Failures:** Hydroponic systems rely on technology, and if equipment fails—whether it be a pump or lighting system—your plants can suffer quickly.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** To ensure your plants thrive, you need to monitor them regularly. This includes checking nutrient levels and ensuring that the environment stays optimal.\n\n### Real Results from Indoor Hydroponic Gardens\n\nSo, are indoor hydroponic gardens actually producing the desired results? Many enthusiasts have reported impressive outcomes. Whether it's thriving herbs, bountiful vegetables, or vibrant flowering plants, the success stories from hydroponic gardeners are plentiful.\n\nPeople who have embraced indoor hydroponics often describe being able to grow crops like lettuce, parsley, and basil more efficiently than traditional methods. Additionally, the satisfaction of harvesting your own food fresh from your living space can be incredibly fulfilling.\n\nShop Here -&amp;gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  \n### Considerations Before Getting Started\n\nBefore jumping into your hydroponic adventure, reflect on a few points:\n\n- **Available Space:** Assess the space you have available for setup and maintenance. A small kitchen or dedicated room is usually best.\n- **Time Commitment:** Think about how much time you can realistically dedicate to monitoring and maintaining your garden. While it may be less than outdoor gardening, it is still vital to stay engaged.\n- **Learning Curve:** Be prepared for a learning phase. Research systems, watch tutorial videos, or consider joining a community to share experiences and advice.\n\nIndoor hydroponic gardens present an innovative way to grow plants indoors with numerous benefits. If you are ready to face the challenges and dedicate the needed time and resources, you might discover a rewarding gardening experience. Ultimately, the choice depends on your goals, available space, and enthusiasm for mastering hydroponic gardening techniques. With the right preparation and effort, your indoor hydroponic garden could flourish, bringing fresh flavors right to your home.\n\nReal-Life Success Stories: Transforming Spaces with Hydroponics\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn today's world, where the demand for fresh produce is ever-increasing and urban living spaces are on the rise, many individuals and communities are turning to hydroponics as a viable solution. Real-life success stories from those who have transformed their spaces using hydroponic techniques serve not only as inspiration but also provide tangible evidence of the effectiveness of this innovative approach.\n\nStart with a look at urban dwellers. Imagine living in a bustling city with limited outdoor space. For many, the dream of growing their own herbs and vegetables in such environments seems impossible. Enter hydroponics—an efficient method that allows city residents to cultivate gardens indoors. Take Sarah, for example, a New York City apartment dweller who decided to convert her small balcony into a vibrant hydroponic garden. Using a vertical system, she grew a variety of herbs like basil, cilantro, and mint. These fresh ingredients not only added flavor to her meals but were also a source of joy and satisfaction. Sarah's story highlights how hydroponics can maximize small spaces creatively.\n\nAnother remarkable story comes from an elementary school in California. The educators at Lincoln Elementary School wanted to teach their students about sustainability and healthy eating. They introduced hydroponics into their science curriculum, installing a small-scale hydroponic system in their classroom. Students became engaged in hands-on learning, planting seedlings and monitoring nutrient levels. The project sparked their interest in botany and nutrition, transforming the way they viewed food. The school cafeteria even began using the freshly harvested lettuce and herbs from the classroom garden. This is a prime example of how hydroponics can be used in educational settings to inspire the next generation.\n\nShop Here -&amp;gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  \nOn a larger scale, we have community gardens popping up in urban areas. In Austin, Texas, a nonprofit organization established a community hydroponic garden to help alleviate food deserts. Volunteers transformed an abandoned lot into a flourishing hydroponic farm. This project not only improved access to fresh produce for local residents but also fostered community spirit. People from all walks of life came together to learn, grow, and share their harvest. The success led to further initiatives, proving that hydroponics can revitalize communities while addressing food insecurity.\n\nFor those looking to make a profit, hydroponics can also be a lucrative business venture. A couple in Oregon started a hydroponic farm in their garage, growing gourmet lettuce and herbs year-round. With careful planning and research, they were able to supply local restaurants and farmers' markets. Their success story showcases how hydroponics can be an economically viable option even in non-traditional farming spaces. By leveraging the advantages of hydroponic systems, they reduced water usage and eliminated the need for pesticides, appealing to environmentally-conscious consumers.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to recognize the challenges that come with hydroponics. Not everyone will experience the same level of success without a bit of dedication and effort. For instance, Mark, a novice hydroponic gardener, struggled initially with maintaining consistent nutrient levels. He faced failure when his first batch of plants wilted. Instead of giving up, he researched better practices and connected with other hydroponic enthusiasts online. His perseverance paid off as he eventually produced a thriving hydroponic garden, but it took time and learning from his mistakes.\n\nThe accounts of individuals and communities harnessing hydroponic technology illustrate the wide array of possibilities. From transforming small apartments to providing fresh produce in schools and communities, hydroponics holds immense potential. Whether it's a personal endeavor, an educational project, or a community initiative, hydroponics can reshape your environment, offering not only fresh food but also an enriching experience. So, if you're looking to make a change in your living space or community, consider diving into the world of hydroponics. The stories of success are waiting to inspire you.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIndoor hydroponic gardens offer an exciting blend of advantages and challenges that can transform not only your space but also your approach to gardening. By evaluating the benefits, such as year-round crop production, space efficiency, and reduced water usage, you can see how hydroponics makes it easier to grow fresh produce, even in the smallest apartments. This sustainable method fosters a deeper connection with nature, all while minimizing the reliance on traditional soil gardening.\n\nShop Here -&amp;gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  \nReal-life success stories from hobbyists and urban farmers illustrate the profound impact that hydroponic systems can have. From small-scale setups in homes to larger community initiatives, individuals are seeing lush harvests of greens, herbs, and even fruits. These transformations highlight the feasibility of indoor hydroponics for anyone, regardless of experience level. Each success paints a picture of growth, showing that with dedication and the right setup, anyone can enjoy the fruits of their labor.\n\nUltimately, whether or not an indoor hydroponic garden is worth it depends on your unique circumstances and goals. If you value sustainability, freshness, and a deeper connection to your food, then the pros likely outweigh the cons. Dive into this innovative gardening method, and you may find that the rewards far surpass the effort. Start small, learn as you grow, and soon, you may be updating friends and family on your very own hydroponic success story.",

    "text": "Looking for help with pros and cons of different Gholdengo versions\nHi all! I know I want to play a Gholdengo deck after rotation hits -- I like the built in draw power and the ability to OHKO nearly everything, and the deck in general has been a ton of fun so far.\n\nHowever, there are a bunch of different versions of the string cheese man going around, and as a pretty amateur player without enough time to test everything myself, I was hoping for some help narrowing down which version to use, and what the pros and cons of each might be. I'll list out some versions with an example City League decklist for each, and I hope someone can help me figure out which will be best for me! Thanks in advance!\n\n  \n[Ghold + Dragapult](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/jp/33444): This was the first list I saw that got me interested in the idea of using dengo at all. The extra draw power from Drakloak increases consistency, and having access to Pult seems strong. However, when I use the deck I find myself not using Pult as an attacker very often (probably a skill issue)\n\n[Ghold + Scizor](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/jp/33761): Less draw power than with pult, but having a single prize attacker who doesn't get walled out by Milo/Cornerstone/Mimikyu seems useful. I think I lean towards this list atm, but how common will boards of many ability-having mons be? I also sometimes see a Scizor EX in these lists, though I don't get why\n\n[Ghold + Dudunsparce](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/jp/33812): Seems like the closest thing to solo-Ghold from what I've seen so far. Extra draw is nice (searchable by fan rotom too), but is the extra draw worth giving up the option for a secondary attacker? ie, why use this over the drakloak/pult version?\n\n[Ghold + Ceruledge](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/jp/16038): Cool combo in theory, ghold gathers all your energy and discards them, ceruledge comes in late game to clean up once everything's in the discard pile. For folks who play this, how do you not just brick every other game with a hand full of energies? \n\n[Ghold + Typhlosion](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/jp/33732): No idea what's going on here tbh, only found this list while searching thru city leagues making this post. Looks cool on first glance, though without really knowing what all the Ethan's pokemon do I feel like I'm kind of missing what makes this deck strong",

    "text": "AITAH for just refusing to cook for my wife at this point?\nI am not OP. That is u/Winter_Reveal_5894 who posted to r/AITAH \n\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/EWh73JQvlm)  **Jan 13th, 2025** \n\nI am 39 and male. My wife, Jennifer, is 37. We have been married for eight years, and we have two children. \n\nI work full-time, and Jennifer is a SAHM. She’s a wonderful mother to our children, but one thing that she does not like to do is cook. This works out just fine for me, as I generally get off work by 4:30, and I happen to be a phenomenal cook. My father was a chef, and I’ve been cooking since I was ten years old. I also worked as a line cook for several years. \n\nVirtually everyone loves my cooking. When we have company, it gets rave reviews. Our children always ask for seconds. I put a lot into it, and I take pride in my cooking skills. \n\nThe only person who doesn’t like it is Jennifer. She complains endlessly. “Too salty.” “Too much pepper.” “This is undercooked.” She also backseat cooks a lot, where I’ll be in the kitchen making something, and she won’t shut up about what I should be doing differently. The worst part, though, is that she’ll frequently insult my cooking and then go get garbage like a Hot Pocket or a frozen dinner from the freezer. \n\nLast Wednesday, I made Salisbury steaks with mushroom gravy, cream cheese mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus. When I put Jennifer’s plate in front of her, she made a disgusted face. She poked at her Salisbury steak for a few seconds and took the tiniest bite imaginable. She then made an exaggerated retching sound, dramatically threw her fork on the plate, and went to heat up a microwave burrito. \n\nI just snapped. I didn’t say anything at the time because our children were there, but I was completely done. The next day, I made teriyaki bowls with broccoli. Jennifer sat at the table waiting for hers, and I informed her that I was done cooking for her. When she asked why, I told her it’s a waste of food, and that she should just go have a Hot Pocket. \n\nJennifer is furious that I won’t cook for her, and she says that instead of giving up, I should try a bit harder. I think she should just subsist on whatever microwaveable slop she likes and stop complaining. Did I escalate too much here? \n\n**Edit:** Thank you for the comments. Unfortunately, people are sending me harassment through private messages, and many of these people come from the same community that has cross-posted this multiple times. I'm going to abandon this reddit account, although in the unlikely scenario that I post an update, I may use it again. I'm just exhausted from reading comments about how I'm supposedly a terrible father for not making the right food for my children and how my wife must be right about my cooking. I am no longer reading responses and DMs. \n\n***Added Comments*** \n\n*Commenter* \n\n(1) Is there *anything* you make that she likes? If not, given others’ general approval of your cooking, does she acknowledge she is a bizarre outlier and must be experiencing something unique to her? \n\n(2) Does she acknowledge as a general matter that it would be frustrating to do all the cooking, and objectively be good at it, and have one’s spouse constantly complain about it? Like is that a concept she would agree is aggravating? If you were to constantly criticize her home management and mothering and then say “try harder” does she acknowledge that would be annoying? \n\n(3) Are there any other significant problems or problematic themes in your marriage along these lines? This seems like there is some possibly deep resentment at play that is hard to understand without more facts. \n\n*OP* \n\n&gt;(1) No. She complains about literally everything I make. \n\n&gt;(2) If she feels this way, she has never voiced it. \n\n&gt;(3) Not particularly. \n\n*Commenter* \n\nNTA. She created this dynamic. Just make sure you and your babies are fed. She doesn't deserve your food, especially since she's being negative on purpose.  \n\n*OP* \n\n&gt;One thing that I take very seriously is how my boys eat. My wife and I are very fortunate to be able to afford good ingredients, so I spend probably more than necessary on food for them. My older boy says he always looks forward to his lunchbox at kindergarten! \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/RUEvApw095)  **Feb 27th, 2025** \n\nAbout a month ago, I posted here about something that happened over dinner one night. My wife, Jennifer, literally retched at my cooking, despite taking the tiniest bite imaginable. After that, I refused to cook for her, which made her very angry. It was this bizarre disconnect between her thinking my food was trash not fit for a compost bin, but her demanding that I continue making it for her anyway. \n\nI was hesitant to update because for some reason beyond my understanding, I received about a dozen hate-filled direct messages after my last post. They were all being sent from users of a parody community of this. I have no idea what I did to make so many people upset, but a lot of people have asked me for an update, so I figured I'd give one. \n\nAnyway. \n\nThe last month has been really eye-opening for me. I had long ago noticed that Jennifer was highly critical of my cooking, but over this time, I've come to realize that she's really critical of just about everything that I do. For example, two weeks ago, I was walking outside with her. I'm pigeon-toed, and have been since I was a baby, although it's a lot better now. Jennifer asked why I was walking with my toes slightly pointed in, and when I explained to her that I'm pigeon-toed, she responded in an exasperated tone, \n\n&gt;...Why don't you just try walking with your feet straight? \n\nYes. Thank you. My literal bone issue was just magically cured by your advice. I never realized that the problem to something I have suffered from for nearly 40 years was staring me right in the face. At least now if I know I ever get cancer, I can just get rid of it by deciding not to have cancer. \n\nYou see, I never really noticed how critical she is towards me on virtually everything I do. She's just more forward about my cooking. For example, when she walks into my home office, she always scrunches up her face in this really displeased way. I don't think she likes the interior (which I designed), because she wants nothing but white and gray in every room in the house. \n\nWhenever I try to do the laundry, she'll hear me open the washing machine door and beeline over to backseat me through the whole process.  This is coming from a woman who once ruined a $1,500 suit of mine because she thought bleach would be the perfect stain remover, by the way. \n\nWhen I was explaining an issue I had with my colleague to her, she took my colleague's side despite her being objectively in the wrong from an industry standpoint. My wife was adamant though. I must have been the one to screw things up. \n\nI'm honestly just exhausted.

    "text": "AITAH for just refusing to cook for my wife at this point?\n**I am not the OOP. The OOP is** u/Winter_Reveal_5894 **posting in** r/AITAH\n\n**Ongoing as per OOP**\n\n**1 update - Medium**\n\n[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i0yeu6/aitah_for_just_refusing_to_cook_for_my_wife_at/) **- 14th January 2025**\n\n[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1izcthh/update_aitah_for_just_refusing_to_cook_for_my/) **- 27th February 2025**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AITAH for just refusing to cook for my wife at this point?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 39 and male. My wife, Jennifer, is 37. We have been married for eight years, and we have two children.\n\nI work full-time, and Jennifer is a SAHM. She’s a wonderful mother to our children, but one thing that she does not like to do is cook. This works out just fine for me, as I generally get off work by 4:30, and I happen to be a phenomenal cook. My father was a chef, and I’ve been cooking since I was ten years old. I also worked as a line cook for several years.\n\nVirtually everyone loves my cooking. When we have company, it gets rave reviews. Our children always ask for seconds. I put a lot into it, and I take pride in my cooking skills.\n\nThe only person who doesn’t like it is Jennifer. She complains endlessly. “Too salty.” “Too much pepper.” “This is undercooked.” She also backseat cooks a lot, where I’ll be in the kitchen making something, and she won’t shut up about what I should be doing differently. The worst part, though, is that she’ll frequently insult my cooking and then go get garbage like a Hot Pocket or a frozen dinner from the freezer.\n\nLast Wednesday, I made Salisbury steaks with mushroom gravy, cream cheese mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus. When I put Jennifer’s plate in front of her, she made a disgusted face. She poked at her Salisbury steak for a few seconds and took the tiniest bite imaginable. She then made an exaggerated retching sound, dramatically threw her fork on the plate, and went to heat up a microwave burrito.\n\nI just snapped. I didn’t say anything at the time because our children were there, but I was completely done. The next day, I made teriyaki bowls with broccoli. Jennifer sat at the table waiting for hers, and I informed her that I was done cooking for her. When she asked why, I told her it’s a waste of food, and that she should just go have a Hot Pocket.\n\nJennifer is furious that I won’t cook for her, and she says that instead of giving up, I should try a bit harder. I think she should just subsist on whatever microwaveable slop she likes and stop complaining. Did I escalate too much here?\n\nEdit: Thank you for the comments. Unfortunately, people are sending me harassment through private messages, and many of these people come from the same community that has cross-posted this multiple times. I'm going to abandon this reddit account, although in the unlikely scenario that I post an update, I may use it again. I'm just exhausted from reading comments about how I'm supposedly a terrible father for not making the right food for my children and how my wife must be right about my cooking. I am no longer reading responses and DMs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QuietRiot7222310**\n\n*NTA Did you marry a five-year-old? She behaved like a child. If you are not willing to do something, you don’t get to complain about the people that do. In my house, whoever is cooking, makes what they make, and everybody else shuts the fuck up and eats it. If you honestly can’t eat it for some reason, you thank the person for making the meal and then make yourself something quietly and politely.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**mogley19922**\n\n*I don't think there's anything wrong with the food to her, she just likes being a dick about something that OP is clearly passionate about.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NoZookeepergame9552**\n\n*NTA - the retching sound and throwing of the fork deserves the cut off without any other discussion, as you are still cooking for the kids and bc your kids should know that that kind of rudeness is not acceptable and comes with reasonable consequences.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Judgement - NTA\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update - 6 weeks later**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago, I posted here about something that happened over dinner one night. My wife, Jennifer, literally retched at my cooking, despite taking the tiniest bite imaginable. After that, I refused to cook for her, which made her very angry. It was this bizarre disconnect between her thinking my food was trash not fit for a compost bin, but her demanding that I continue making it for her anyway.\n\nI was hesitant to update because for some reason beyond my understanding, I received about a dozen hate-filled direct messages after my last post. They were all being sent from users of a parody community of this. I have no idea what I did to make so many people upset, but a lot of people have asked me for an update, so I figured I'd give one.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe last month has been really eye-opening for me. I had long ago noticed that Jennifer was highly critical of my cooking, but over this time, I've come to realize that she's really critical of just about everything that I do. For example, two weeks ago, I was walking outside with her. I'm pigeon-toed, and have been since I was a baby, although it's a lot better now. Jennifer asked why I was walking with my toes slightly pointed in, and when I explained to her that I'm pigeon-toed, she responded in an exasperated tone,\n\n...Why don't you just try walking with your feet straight?\n\nYes. Thank you. My literal bone issue was just magically cured by your advice. I never realized that the problem to something I have suffered from for nearly 40 years was staring me right in the face. At least now if I know I ever get cancer, I can just get rid of it by deciding not to have cancer.\n\nYou see, I never really noticed how critical she is towards me on virtually everything I do. She's just more forward about my cooking. For example, when she walks into my home office, she always scrunches up her face in this really displeased way. I don't think she likes the interior (which I designed), because she wants nothing but white and gray in every room in the house.\n\nWhenever I try to do the laundry, she'll hear me open the washing machine door and beeline over to backseat me through the whole process. This is coming from a woman who once ruined a $1,500 suit of mine because she thought bleach would be the perfect stain remover, by the way.\n\nWhen I was explaining an issue I had with my colleague to her, she took my colleague's side despite her being objectively in the wrong from an industry standpoint. My wife was adamant though. I must have been the one to screw things up.\n\nI'm honestly just exhausted. The criticism of my cooking was the worst, yes, but it really just overshadowed everything else she always found fault with me on.\n\nI tried to have a conversation with her, and naturally she denied doing anything of the sort, denied ever being rude to me, and even denied retching at my food. She actually tried to gaslight me here. She kept asking me questions like \"When did I do that? Tell me the date.\" Then she called me a hypocrite for being critical of her, hijacked the conversation, and eventually stonewalled me.\n\nI've come to realize that I don't really like my wife anymore. She's just such a negative person. It makes me sad, but in the next few days, I'm going to ask her for a divorce. She's not going to like it, but I've come to realize that when she walks into a room I'm in, I get anxious about what she's going to say to me.\n\nThank you for all your comments. I also apologize if this was long-winded. My marriage is falling apart and I'm not in the best headspace right now.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice. I'm getting hate messages from that community again, and I really don't need this as I have to deal with child custody, divorce, assets, and telling my children that Mommy and Daddy are going to be separating.

Divorce lawyer will tell you exactly what you should and shouldn't say and do after dropping the bombshell.*\n\n*For example- don't leave the house. Don't sleep elsewhere. Don't in any way stop spending time with kids. Don't abandon any parental duties.*\n\n*Depending on the finances involved, it might be cheaper to buy her a month long vacation in Hawaii to get her out of the house and establish yourself as primary parent than to go through a custody/housing battle.*\n\n*TALK TO A LAWYER FIRST!!!!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**rong-rite**\n\n*You don’t ASK your wife for a divorce.
