Review GEO Pulse app.py against the executive QA checklist in REVIEW.md.

Instructions:
1. Read REVIEW.md for the full checklist.
2. Read app.py and evaluate every checklist item.
3. Score each dimension (Signal Quality, Competitor Intelligence, Roadmap Quality, Design System, Performance).
4. Output the results in the format specified in REVIEW.md.
5. For every BLOCKER, include the exact file path and line number.
6. For every HIGH priority item, include a suggested fix.
7. Give an overall score out of 10.

Be ruthless. The standard is: "Can a time-pressed exec open this app and get a genuine insight within 60 seconds?" If the answer is no, it's a blocker.
